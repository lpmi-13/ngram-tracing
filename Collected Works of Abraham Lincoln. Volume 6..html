<div class="opener">To the Senate of the United States: December 13, 1862</div>
<p>In the list of nominations transmitted to the Senate under date of the 1st instant, Captain Wm. M. Glendy, U.S. Navy, was included therein for promotion to the grade of commodore.</p>
<p>Since submitting this nomination it appears that this officer was ineligible for the advancement to which he had been nominated, in consequence of his age, being sixty-two on the 23d of May, 1862, and under the law of 21 December, 1861, should, had this fact been known to the Navy Department, have been transferred to the retired list on the day when he completed sixty-two years.</p>
<p>The nomination of Captain Glendy is accordingly withdrawn.</p>
<p>It is due to this officer to state that at the period of the passage of the law of December, 1861, he was, and still is, absent on duty on a foreign station, and the certificate of his age, required by the Navy Department, was only received a few days since.</p>

See Lincoln to Welles, August 2, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>, and endorsement of January 15, 1863, <span class="rend-i">infra.</span> On September 10, 1862, Isaac R. Diller wrote Lincoln as follows:</p>
<p>``After consultation with Captain Dahlgreen, I have come to the conclusion not to attempt to make the large quantity of the new powder which he will require for full tests, in this City. In my opinion it would not be safe to do so, on account of the secrecy necessary to be observed in its manufacture.</p>
<p>``In my opinion the expense, incurred in the manufacture of the required amount will not exceed five hundred dollars,---provided I have permission to draw from the public stores such articles as are on hand.</p>
<p>``The sum specified will be used only for the purpose of purchasing certain necessary means for making it, which will always be found useful in the public laboratory connected with the Agricultural Department of the Government.</p>
<p>``Before commencing these experiments it will be positively necessary for me to return to the West for a few days and I respectfully ask that transportation be furnished me for that purpose.</p>
<p>``I propose to do this work in Philadelphia, and in this determination Capt. Dahlgreen concurs.</p>
<p>``When I am prepared to commence operations, I have the honor to ask that Dr. Charles M. Wetherill, Chief Chemist of the Agricultural Department, be again assigned to me to conduct the manufacture, and experiments, as he is the only person, except myself, familiar with the process of manufacture, in this country.</p>
<p>``The expenses already incurred, not counting my time or that of the Chemist, amounts to two hundred &amp; fifty-five dollars.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;4</span>On October 17, 1862, Charles M. Wetherill wrote Lincoln as follows:</p>
<p>``Having understood that Captain Diller is ready to have me detailed back to the Department of Agriculture, I desire to make the following statement. I have brought my chemical apparatus (which I value at $3000) to Washington by Captain Dillers directions. I have used it in the experiments without charge to the Government.</p>
<p>``I have placed this apparatus together with my scientific library (which I value at $2000) at the disposal of the Department of Agriculture to be used by me in the prosecution of researches in agricultural chemistry, until Congress shall provide for the Chemistry of the Department. As I place $5000 of my Capital at the disposal of the Government, without interest I think I should be made secure in its ownership. As soon as I am detailed back to the Dept. of Agriculture I lose possession of my apparatus unless said room is in the possession of the Commissioner. I have therefore respectfully to request that this laboratory tranfer be made or that I be otherwise made secure in my ownership before I am detailed back to my Department.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, Wetherill was appointed chemist in the Department of Agriculture (New York <span class="rend-i">Tribune</span>, October 27, 1862), and the experiment was undertaken. On December 10, Diller submitted the following document to the president and received Lincoln's endorsement (dated December 15, as given above):</p>
<p>``The undersigned, Isaac R. Diller, a citizen of the United States, and resident of the State of Illinois, would respectfully represent; that I am the owner and possessor of a process of making an article of gunpowder entirely unknown and unused in the United States.</p>
<p>``I propose to place the art of manufacturing the said powder and every thing pertaining to the complete understanding of its composition, in the possession of the Government of the United States, on the condition, that as soon as the amount hereafter specified has been made, and the article being tested by said Government, and being found to possess the qualities and advantages claimed for it, then and in that case in consideration therefor, the said Government is to pay, or cause to be paid, to the undersigned, the sum of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($150,000).</p>
<p>``The said tests to be carried on and conducted by officers of the said Government, to be selected by the President, in the presence of the undersigned, and at as an early a day as possible, after a notification from the undersigned that the material is prepared.</p>
<p>``When the said tests are completed, if successful and satisfactory to the said Government, I will then place them in possession of the said art and mode of compounding the said article of gunpowder, whereupon the above sum is then to be paid, as above stipulated.</p>
<p>``I further propose to proceed immediately, upon the approval of these propositions, by the President of the United States, to prepare a sufficient quantity of the said article for the tests aforesaid, not exceeding one thousand pounds, the said Government agreeing to pay all charges and expenses incurred in the preparation of the said quantity, and the machinery necessary therefor.</p>
<p>``I propose to file full specifications of the advantages claimed for the new powder, in the office of Captain J. A. Dahlgren, chief of the Bureau of Ordnance in the Navy Department, within ten days from the date and approval of the above propositions by the President.</p>
<p>``I have the honor to be Very Respectfully Your Obedient Servant</p>
<p>ISAAC R. DILLER.''</p>
<p>``Specification of the advantages claimed for the `R.R.R. Gunpowder' made a part of this paper by direction of the President.</p>
<p>``1. It contains neither saltpetre nor sulphur. It bears no relation to gun-cotton. The ingredients can always be obtained in the United States.</p>
<p>``2. The manufacture of the powder is simple, requiring no complicated apparatus,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;5</span>
and is attended with less danger than the manufacture of ordinary gunpowder.</p>
<p>``3. Atmospheric changes, whether of moisture, or heat, do not injure the powder. Like ordinary gunpowder, it requires a great pressure or friction for its explosion. It does not ignite under 300deg. Celsius. It may be ignited by a spark, or percussion cap, like common gunpowder.</p>
<p>``4. In smooth-bored guns, <span class="rend-i">seven</span> parts by weight of this powder, are, as effective as <span class="rend-i">nine</span> parts by weight of ordinary gunpowder, while in rifled guns, this advantage is in the proportion of <span class="rend-i">one</span> to <span class="rend-i">two</span>.</p>
<p>``5. Neither this powder, nor its ingredients in store, are liable to deteriorate.</p>
<p>``6. The heating effect of this powder is less than that of ordinary powder, in the proportion of one to two. It gives a weaker report, less smoke, and fouls the gun much less than ordinary gunpowder. It does not damage the gun.</p>
<p>``7. In comparing equal weights of this with ordinary gunpowder, the estimated cost is about equal---but the smaller amount required of this powder, renders it greatly advantageous on the score of economy.</p>

I try to study the surrounding elements, and move troops away just as fast as I think the safety of community will permit, and will probably soon withdraw all or nearly all the volunteers from Northern Missouri. Another trouble intervenes. The Enrolled Militia when in actual service are fed by the United States, and levy contributions from the secessionists to indemnify themselves for losses. . . .

<p>To the Army of the Potomac: I have just read your Commanding General's preliminary report of the battle of Fredericksburg. Although you were not successful, the attempt was not an error, nor the failure other than an accident. The courage with which you, in an open field, maintained the contest against an entrenched foe, and the consummate skill and success with which you crossed and re-crossed the river, in face of the enemy, show that you possess all the qualities of a great army, which will yet give victory to the cause of the country and of popular government. Condoling with the mourners for the dead, and sympathizing with the severely wounded, I congratulate you that the number of both is comparatively so small.</p>
<p>I tender to you, officers and soldiers, the thanks of the nation.</p>

In the Lincoln Papers there is what appears to be a draft in an unidentified handwriting of a proclamation, or order of thanks, prepared for Lincoln to issue to the Army of the Potomac on this occasion. It bears little resemblance to Lincoln's communication as issued. The editors venture no guess as to its author, but reproduce it herewith:<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;14</span></p>
<p>``The President, commander in chief, returns his thanks to the generals, the officers, and the soldiers of the Army of the Potomac for the skill, discipline, valor, and devotion displayed in the Battle of Fredericksburg.</p>
<p>``An army of citizen soldiers largely composed of volunteers fresh from the peaceful occupations which have been heretofore the privilege and the duty of American citizens, you have bridged and crossed a deep and wide river in the face of a powerful foe, have arrayed yourselves with the regularity and order of veterans, have attacked with heroic valor an army in positions fortified with time and skill, and unsuccessful in the assault through the unexpected strength of the position and the number and desperate courage of the foe---misguided children of the same soil and the same race as yourselves, you continued the bloody conflict until night put an end to the unequal struggle.</p>
<p>``Resting on your arms upon the ensanguined field, the dawning day saw you still in firm and regular order offer battle to the enemy.</p>
<p>``Through a whole day the gage was declined.</p>
<p>``The foe had learned the strength of an army of citizen soldiers striking for their country, for the cause of orderly government and human rights. He declined to quit his vantage ground and accept the contest on an equal field.</p>
<p>``During a dark and stormy night you recrossed on narrow bridges the river in your rear, without haste, in close and regular order, without the loss of a color, a gun, and, save in battle, of a man.</p>
<p>``An army which has done this, has answered all the objections heretofore made against the discipline, the steadiness, or the skill of volunteers.</p>
<p>``It has shown that it confides in its leaders; that it can obey orders, and that for every evolution of war, this army of the people is competent as the trained troops of mercenaries on which rulers of other lands rely for defense and for aggression.</p>
<p>``The land mourns the loss of many gallant dead. They are heroes, dead for Liberty.</p>
<p>``Their names will live in the memory of the people from whom they came and whose cause they died to defend. And while it will be a sad page which records the story of the Battle of Fredericksburg, still, it will be blazoned with the names of patriots and gilded with the fires of heroism and of self devotion.</p>
<p>``We fight the battle of Liberty, not in this land only, but throughout the world.</p>
<p>``All lands have looked to America as the home of freedom, as the refuge of the oppressed.</p>
<p>``Upon the courage of her sons now depend the hopes of the world, and wherever the story of Fredericksburg is read, will the lovers of Liberty take courage.</p>
<p>``Soldiers of freedom, again your country thanks you.</p>
<p>``This order will be read at the head of every regiment of the Army of the United States.</p>
<p>``Given at the Executive Mansion, in the City of Washington, this 21st day of December, in the year of our Lord 1862, and of the Independence of the United States the 87th.''</p>

<p>Yours of the 20th. suggesting a plan of operations for the Army of the Potomac, is received.

Meanwhile let me say it seems to me to present the old questions of preference between the line of the Peninsula, and the line you are now upon. The difficulties you point out as pertaining to the Fredericksburg line are obvious and palpable. But now, as heretofore, if you go to James River, a large part of the army must remain on or near the Fredericksburg line, to protect Washington. It is the old difficulty.</p>
<p>When I saw Gen.

The lengthy letter of December 20 from Major Generals Franklin and Smith advocated the return to a plan of attack via the James River and expressed the generals' opinion that ``the plan of campaign already commenced will not be successful'' (OR, I, XXI, 868-70). On January 23, 1863, Burnside issued an order relieving Smith and Franklin from their commands: ``It being evident [they] can be of no further service to this army. . . .''

The fortifications of Harpers Ferry is another important requisite. These matters were considered as of course and did not enter into our discussion of the two plans of campaign.</p>
<p>``I presume that you are right in supposing that I advised the withdrawal of the army from James River in July last. I think that under the same circumstances I would give the same advice. The Army was debilitated by what it had already gone through, was in an unhealthy position, its sick list was enormous, and there<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;16</span>

My Dear Sir Washington December 28th. 1862.</div>
<p>I have twice declined to see you on the ground that I understood the object of your desired interview, and that it was a matter of embarrassment to me. My real respect and esteem for you makes me unwilling to leave the matter in quite so abrupt a form. My embarrassment is that the place you seek not selfishly I think, is greedily sought by many others; and there is sure to be opposition both fierce and plausible to the appointment of any one who up to this time has not been in the military service. What answer to it will I make? Shall I say I did it for political influence? That will<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;22</span>
be the more loudly objected to. I need not point out to you where this objection will come from. It will come from your competitors; it will come from party spirit; it will come from indignant members of Congress who will perceive in it an attempt of mine to set a guardian over them.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; Copies, DLC-RTL. Lincoln's autograph draft has not been found, but copies were prepared and distributed to members of the cabinet at the meeting on December 30. Each member was requested to offer suggestions. The copies received by Stanton and Welles have not been located, but those of Bates, Blair, Chase, and Seward are in the Lincoln Papers together with each member's suggestions for revision. In addition to submitting an entirely new redrafting of his own, which Lincoln did not use, Chase on December 31 made the following suggestions:</p>
<p>`` . . . It seems to me wisest to make no exception of parts of States from the operation of the Proclamation, save the Forty-eight Counties designated as West-Virginia. . . .</p>
<p>``I think it would be expedient to omit from the proposed Proclamation the declaration that the Executive Government of the United States will do no act to repress the enfranchised in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom.</p>
<p>``This clause in the September Proclamation has been widely quoted as an incitement to servile insurrection. In lieu of it, and for the purpose of shaming these misrepresentations, I think it would be well to insert some such clause as this: `not encouraging or countenancing, however, any disorderly or licentious conduct.' If this alteration is made, the appeal to the enslaved may properly enough be omitted. It does not appear to be necessary, and may furnish a topic to the evil-disposed for censure and ridicule. . . .</p>
<p>``I think it absolutely certain that the rebellion can in no way be so certainly, speedily and economically suppressed as by the organized military force of the loyal population of the insurgent regions, of whatever complection. In no way can irregular violence and servile insurrection be so surely prevented as by the regular organization and regular military employment of those who might otherwise probably resort to such courses.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;25</span>``Such organization is now in successful progress. . . .</p>
<p>``Considering these facts, it seems to me that it would be best to omit from the Proclamation all reference to the military employment of the enfranchised population, leaving it to the natural course of things already well begun; or to state distinctly that in order to secure the suppression of the rebellion without servile insurrection or licentious marauding, such numbers of the population declared free as may be found convenient will be employed in the military and naval service of the United States. . . .</p>
<p>``Finally, I respectfully suggest that on an occasion of such interest, there can be no just imputation of affectation against a solemn recognition of responsibility before men and before God; and that some such close as follows will be proper:---</p>
<p>`` `And upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice warranted by the Constitution, and of duty demanded by the circumstances of the country, I invoke the considerate judgment of Mankind and the gracious favor of Almighty God.' ''</p>
<p>Bates' suggestions (undated but either December 31 or January 1) are as follows:</p>
<p>``I respectfully suggest that</p>
<p>``1. The President issues the proclamation `by virtue of the power in <span class="rend-i">him</span> vested, as <span class="rend-i">commander in chief of the army &amp; navy</span> of the United States, in time of <span class="rend-i">actual, armed rebellion</span>' &amp;c---`and as a proper &amp; necessary <span class="rend-i">war measure</span>, for suppressing said rebellion---' Date January 1863.</p>
<p>``2. It is done <span class="rend-i">in accordance with</span> the first proclamation---of Sept 22nd 1862.</p>
<p>``3. It distinguishes between <span class="rend-i">States &amp; parts of States</span>, and designates those States &amp; parts of States, `in which the people thereof, respectively, ARE THIS DAY, (Jan 1, 1863) <span class="rend-i">in rebellion</span> against the United States.'</p>
<p>``These three propositions being true, I think they ought to be followed out, without excess or diminution, by action, not by the declaration of a principle nor the establishment of a law, for the future guidance of others. It is a <span class="rend-i">war measure</span> by the President---a matter of fact---not a law by the legislature.</p>
<p>``And as to what is proposed to be done in the future, the least said the better. Better leave yourself free to act in the emergencies, as they arise, with as few embarrassing committals as possible.</p>
<p>``Whether a particular State or part of a State, is or is not in <span class="rend-i">actual rebellion</span>, on the 1st. Jany 1863, is a simple matter of fact, which the President, in the first proclamation, has promised to declare in the second. Of course, it must be <span class="rend-i">truly</span> declared: It is no longer open, to be determined, as a matter of policy or prudence, independently of the <span class="rend-i">fact</span>.</p>
<p>``And this applies, with particular force, to Virginia. The Eastern shore of Virginia &amp; the region round about Norfolk, are now (Dec. 31, 1862) more free from <span class="rend-i">actual</span> rebellion than are several of the 48 Counties spoken of as West Virginia.</p>
<p>``If the latter be exempt from the proclamation, so also ought the former. And so, in all the States that are considered <span class="rend-i">in parts</span>.</p>
<p>``The last paragraph of the draft, I consider wholly useless, and probably injurious---being a needless pledge of future action---which may be quite as well done without as with the pledge.''</p>
<p>Blair's suggestions (undated but either December 31 or January 1) and Seward's (December 30) are given in the succeeding footnotes appended to the particular passages affected.</p>
</div>
<a name="6_24_1"></a><div class="textindentlevelx" id="6_24_1">
<p>[2]&nbsp;&nbsp; Blair's suggested revision of the remainder of the draft is as follows (portions in parentheses are on a separate sheet marked for insertion as given here):</p>
<p>``I do order &amp; declare that all persons held as slaves within said designated states &amp; parts of states shall be free; and that the Executive Government of the United States, including the Military &amp; Naval authorities will recognize &amp; maintain the freedom of said persons. And in order that they may render all the aid they are willing to give to this object &amp; to the support of the Government, authority will be given to receive them in to the service whenever they can be usefully employed &amp; they may be armed to garrison forts, to defend positions &amp; stations and to man<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;26</span>
vessels. And (whilst) I appeal to them to show themselves worthy of freedom by fidelity &amp; diligence in the employments which may be given to them by the observance of order &amp; by abstaining from all violence not required by duty or for self defence. (It is due to them to say that the conduct of large numbers of these people since the war began justifies confidence in their fidelity &amp; humanity generally).''</p>

<div class="textindentlevelx">
<div class="opener">[December 31, 1862]</div>
<p>The consent of the Legislature of Virginia is constitutionally necessary to the bill for the admission of West-Virginia becoming a law. A body claiming to be such Legislature has given it's consent. We can not well deny that it is such, unless we do so upon the outside knowledge that the body was chosen at elections, in which a majority of the qualified voters of Virginia did not participate.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;27</span>But it is a universal practice in the popular elections in all these states, to give no legal consideration whatever to those who do not choose to vote, as against the effect of the votes of those, who do choose to vote. Hence it is not the qualified voters, but the qualified voters, <span class="rend-i">who choose to vote</span>, that constitute the political power of the state. Much less than to non-voters, should any consideration be given to those who did not vote, <span class="rend-i">in this case</span>: because it is also matter of outside knowledge, that they were not merely neglectful of their rights under, and duty to, this government, but were also engaged in open rebellion against it. Doubtless<span class="ptr"><a name="6_27_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_27_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> among these non-voters were some Union men whose voices were smothered by the more numerous secessionists; but we know too little of their number to assign them any appreciable value. Can this government stand, if it indulges constitutional constructions by which men in open rebellion against it, are to be accounted, man for man, the equals of those who maintain their loyalty to it? Are they to be accounted even better citizens, and more worthy of consideration, than those who merely neglect to vote? If so, their treason against the constitution, enhances their constitutional value! Without braving these absurd conclusions, we can not deny that the body which consents to the admission of West-Virginia, is the Legislature of Virginia. I<span class="ptr"><a name="6_27_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_27_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> do not think the plural form of the words ``Legislatures'' and ``States'' in the phrase of the constitution ``without the consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned &amp;c'' has any reference to the <span class="rend-i">new</span> State concerned. That plural form sprang from the contemplation of two or more old States contributing to form a new one. The idea that the new state was in danger of being admitted without its own consent, was not provided against, because it was not thought of, as I conceive. It is said, the devil takes care of his own. Much more should a good spirit---the spirit of the Constitution and the Union---take care of it's own. I think it can not do less, and live.</p>
<p>But is the admission into the Union, of West-Virginia, expedient. This, in my general view, is more a question for Congress, than for the Executive. Still I do not evade it. More than on anything else, it depends on whether the admission or rejection of the new state would under all the circumstances tend the more strongly to the restoration of the national authority throughout the Union.

time. Doutless those in remaining Virginia would return to the Union, so to speak, less reluctantly without the division of the old state than with it; but I think we could not save as much in this quarter by rejecting the new state, as we should lose by it in West-Virginia. We can scarcely dispense with the aid of West-Virginia in this struggle; much less can we afford to have her against us, in congress and in the field. Her brave and good men regard her admission into the Union as a matter of life and death. They have been true to the Union under very severe trials. We have so acted as to justify their hopes; and we can not fully retain their confidence, and co-operation, if we seem to break faith with them. In fact, they could not do so much for us, if they would.</p>
<p>Again, the admission of the new state, turns that much slave soil to free; and thus, is a certain, and irrevocable encroachment upon the cause of the rebellion.</p>
<p>The division of a State is dreaded as a precedent. But a measure made expedient by a war, is no precedent for times of peace. It is said that the admission of West-Virginia, is secession, and tolerated only because it is our secession. Well, if we call it by that name, there is still difference enough between secession against the constitution, and secession in favor of the constitution.</p>
<p>I believe the admission of West-Virginia into the Union is expedient.</p>

<div class="opener">January 1, 1863</div>
<p>By the President of the United States of America:</p>
<p>A Proclamation.</p>
<p>Whereas, on the twentysecond day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty two, a proclamation was issued by the President of the United States, containing, among other things, the following, towit:</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;29</span>``That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the Executive Government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom.</p>
<p>``That the Executive will, on the first day of January aforesaid, by proclamation, designate the States and parts of States, if any, in which the people thereof, respectively, shall then be in rebellion against the United States; and the fact that any State, or the people thereof, shall on that day be, in good faith, represented in the Congress of the United States by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such State shall have participated, shall, in the absence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that such State, and the people thereof, are not then in rebellion against the United States.''</p>
<p>Now, therefore I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested as Commander-in-Chief, of the Army and Navy of the United States in time of actual armed rebellion against authority and government of the United States, and as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion, do, on this first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty three, and in accordance with my purpose so to do publicly proclaimed for the full period of one hundred days, from the day first above mentioned, order and designate as the States and parts of States wherein the people thereof respectively, are this day in rebellion against the United States, the following, towit:</p>
<p>Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, (except the Parishes of St. Bernard, Plaquemines, Jefferson, St. Johns, St. Charles, St. James[,] Ascension, Assumption, Terrebonne, Lafourche, St. Mary, St. Martin, and Orleans, including the City of New-Orleans) Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South-Carolina, North-Carolina, and Virginia, (except the fortyeight counties designated as West Virginia, and also the counties of Berkley, Accomac, Northampton, Elizabeth-City, York, Princess Ann, and Norfolk, including the cities of Norfolk &amp; Portsmouth [)]; and which excepted parts are, for the present, left precisely as if this proclamation were not issued.</p>
<p>And by virtue of the power, and for the purpose aforesaid, I do order and declare that all persons held as slaves within said designated States, and parts of States, are, and henceforward shall be<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;30</span>
free; and that the Executive government of the United States, including the military and naval authorities thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons.</p>
<p>And I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free to abstain from all violence, unless in necessary self-defence; and I recommend to them that, in all cases when allowed, they labor faithfully for reasonable wages.</p>
<p>And I further declare and make known, that such persons of suitable condition, will be received into the armed service of the United States to garrison forts, positions, stations, and other places, and to man vessels of all sorts in said service.</p>
<p>And upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice, warranted by the Constitution, upon military necessity, I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind, and the gracious favor of Almighty God.</p>
<p>In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

Lincoln's original autograph of the proclamation was sold in 1863 (see Lincoln's letter to Ladies in charge of North Western Fair, October 26, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>), at the Chicago North-western Sanitary Fair, to Thomas B. Bryan, who presented it to the Soldiers' Home in Chicago. It was lithographed ``and thousands [of dollars] were realized by the Chicago Soldiers Home from the sale of copies. . . .'' (Charles Bryan, son, to Nicolay, November 24, 1886, DLC-Nicolay Papers. See also Lincoln to Bryan, January 18, 1864, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>.) In 1871 the original was burned in the Chicago Fire. Prior to the Chicago Fair in 1863 the historian Benson J. Lossing also had prevailed upon Lincoln to allow him to have a facsimile made for use in his <span class="rend-i">Pictorial History of the Civil War</span>. On October 29, 1863, John Hay forwarded to Lossing a photograph made at Lincoln's direction, with apologies for ``blots on the edges'' which were ``incidental to the copying, and are not in the original'' (ALS, RPB). Three photographic copies of the original preserved in the Lincoln Papers, presumably made at the same time as the copy sent to Lossing, have provided the present text. The official engrossed document in The National Archives follows Lincoln's original. (For a detailed study of the various printings of the proclamation, see Charles Eberstadt, ``Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation,'' <span class="rend-i">The New Colophon</span>, 1950, pp. 312-56.)</p>
<p>Lincoln's final proclamation was not completed until January 1 after consultation with the cabinet and study of the suggestions for revision submitted by the several members on December 31. Nicolay telegraphed Horace Greeley and Henry J. Raymond on the afternoon of December 31 that ``The Proclamation cannot be telegraphed to you until during the day tomorrow (telegrams, RPB). Telegrams from John A. Dix and Michael Hahn on December 31 defined the<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;31</span>
parts of Virginia and Louisiana not then in rebellion which were to be exempted by the proclamation (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>The photographic copies of the original autograph show the superscription ``By the President of the United States of America: A Proclamation.'' to be in the hand of a clerk. The excerpt from the preliminary proclamation of September 22, which appears as paragraphs two and three in the final proclamation, is in the form of a clipping from the State Department circular printing of the preliminary proclamation, with quotation marks added by Lincoln. The formal close, ``In witness whereof,'' etc., is also added in the handwriting of a clerk. Otherwise the body of the proclamation is in Lincoln's handwriting.</p>

Brigadier General John McNeil of the Missouri State Militia had on October 18, 1862, executed ten rebel guerrillas at Palmyra, Missouri. On November 17, Jefferson Davis ordered Theophilus H.

<p>Gen. Burnside wishes to cross the Rappahannock with his army, but his Grand Division commanders all oppose the movement. If in such a difficulty as this you do not help, you fail me precisely in the point for which I sought your assistance. You know what Gen. Burnside's plan is; and it is my wish that you go with him to the ground, examine it as far as practicable, confer with the officers, getting their judgment, and ascertaining their temper, in a word, gather all the elements for forming a judgment of your own; and then tell Gen. Burnside that you <span class="rend-i">do</span> approve, or that you do <span class="rend-i">not</span> approve his plan. Your military skill is useless to me, if you will not do this.

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy ALS $$$ Feb. 17, 1970. ALS, DLC-RTL. Lincoln's endorsement, incorrectly dated ``Jan. 1. 1862'' is written on the back of the letter. On January 1, Major General Burnside wrote Lincoln as follows:</p>
<p>``Since leaving you this morning, I have determined that it is my duty to place on paper the remarks which I made to you, in order that you may use them or not, as you see proper.</p>
<p>``I am in command . . . of nearly 200,000 men, 120,000 of whom are in the immediate presence of the enemy, and I cannot conscientiously retain the command without making an unreserved statement of my views.</p>
<p>``The Secretary of War has not the confidence of the officers and soldiers, and I feel sure that he has not the confidence of the country. In regard to the latter statement, you are probably better informed than I am. The same opinion applies with equal force in regard to General Halleck. It seems to be the universal opinion that the movements of the army have not been planned with a view to co-operation and mutual assistance.</p>
<p>``I have attempted a movement upon the enemy, in which I have been repulsed, and I am convinced, after mature deliberation, that the army ought to make another movement in the same direction, not necessarily at the same points on the river; but I am not sustained in this by a single grand division commander in my command. My reasons for having issued the order for making this second movement I have already given you in full, and I can see no reasons for changing my views. Doubtless this difference of opinion between my general officers and myself results from a lack of confidence in me. In this case it is highly necessary that this army should be commanded by some other officer, to whom I will most cheerfully give way.</p>
<p>``Will you allow me, Mr. President, to say that it is of the utmost importance that you be surrounded and supported by men who have the confidence of the people and of the army, and who will at all times give you definite and honest opinions in relation to their separate departments, and at the same time give you positive and unswerving support in your public policy, taking at all times their full share of the responsibility for that policy? In no positions held by gentlemen near you are these conditions more requisite than those of the Secretary of War and General-in-Chief and the commanders of your armies. In the struggle now going on, in which the very existence of our Government is at stake, the interests of no one man are worth the value of a grain of sand, and no one should be allowed to stand in the way of accomplishing the greatest amount of public good.</p>
<p>``It is my belief that I ought to retire to private life. I hope you will not understand this to savor of anything like dictation. My only desire is to promote the public good. No man is an accurate judge of the confidence in which he is held by the public and the people around him, and the confidence in my management may be entirely destroyed, in which case it would be a great wrong for me to retain this command for a single day; and, as I before said, I will most cheerfully give place to any other officer.'' (OR, I, XXI, 941-42. This letter does not appear in the Lincoln Papers, and a footnote to the text in the source specifies ``This letter is printed from General Burnside's copy.'')</p>
<p>On the same day General Halleck wrote Stanton the following letter of resignation:</p>
<p>``Sir: From my recent interview with the President and yourself, and from the President's letter of this morning, which you delivered to me at your reception, I am led to believe that there is a very important difference of opinion in regard to my relations toward generals commanding armies in the field, and that I cannot perform the duties of my present office satisfactorily at the same time to the President and to myself. I therefore respectfully request that I may be relieved from further duties as General-in-Chief.'' (OR, I, XXI, 940-41. A footnote in the source reads as follows: ``As duplicates are found among General</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;33</span>Halleck's papers, and no copy is found in the War Department files, it is presumed that the application was withdrawn upon withdrawal of the President's letter.'')</p>

<div class="opener">Executive Mansion,<br>
Major General Curtis Washington, January 2, 1863.</div>
<p>My dear Sir: Yours of Dec. 29th. by the hand of Mr. Strong is just received. The day I telegraphed you suspending the order in relation to Dr. McPheters, he, with Mr. Bates, the Attorney General, appeared before me, and left with me a copy of the order mentioned. The Dr. also showed me the copy of an oath which he said he had taken, which is, indeed, very strong, and specific. He also verbally assured me that he had constantly prayed in church for the President and Government, as he had always done before the present war. In looking over the recitals in your order, I do not see that this matter of the prayer, as he states it, is negatived; nor that any violation of his oath is charged; nor, in fact, that any thing specific is alledged against him. The charges are all general ---that he has a rebel wife &amp; rebel relations, that he sympathizes with rebels, and that he exercises rebel influence. Now, after talking with him, I tell you frankly, I believe he does sympathize with the rebels; but the question remains whether such a man, of<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;34</span>
unquestioned good moral character, who has taken such an oath as he has, and can not even be charged of violating it, and who can be charged with no other specific act or omision, can, with safety to the government be exiled, upon the suspicion of his secret sympathies. But I agree that this must be left to you who are on the spot; and if, after all, you think the public good requires his removal, my suspension of the order is withdrawn, only with this qualification that the time during the suspension, is not to be counted against him. I have promised him this.</p>
<p>But I must add that the U.S. government must not, as by this order, undertake to run the churches. When an individual, in a church or out of it, becomes dangerous to the public interest, he must be checked; but let the churches, as such take care of themselves. It will not do for the U.S. to appoint Trustees, Supervisors, or other agents for the churches. Yours very truly</p>
<p>A. LINCOLN</p>

<div class="opener">Executive Mansion,<br>
Major General Curtis Washington, January 5, 1863.</div>
<p>My dear Sir: I am having a good deal of trouble with Missouri matters, and I now sit down to write you particularly about it. One class of friends believe in greater severity, and another in greater leniency, in regard to arrests, banishments, and assessments. As usual in such cases, each questions the other's motives. On the one hand it is insisted that Gov. Gamble's Unionism, at most, is not better than a secondary spring of action---that hunkerism, and a wish for political influence, stand before Unionism, with him. On the other hand, it is urged that arrests, banishments, and assessments are made more for private malice, revenge, and pecuniary interest, than for the public good. This morning I was told by a gentleman who, I have no doubt believes what he says,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;37</span>
that in one case of assessments for <span class="rend-i">ten</span> thousand dollars, the different persons who paid, compared receipts, and found they had paid thirty thousand dollars. If this be true, the inference is that the collecting agents pocketed the odd twenty thousand. And true or not, in the instance, nothing but the sternest necessity can justify the making and maintaining of a system so liable to such abuses. Doubtless the necessity<span class="ptr"><a name="6_37_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_37_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> for the making of the system in Missouri <span class="rend-i">did</span> exist, and whether it continues for the maintainance of it, is now a practical, and very important question. Some days ago Governor Gamble telegraphed me asking that the assessments, outside of St. Louis county, might be suspended, as they already have been within it; and this morning all the members of congress here from Missouri, but one, lay a paper before me asking the same thing. Now, my belief is that Gov. Gamble is an honest and true man, not less so than yourself; that you and he could confer together on this, and other Missouri questions with great advantage to the public; that each knows something which the other does not, and that, acting together, you could about double your stock of pertinent information. May I not hope that you and he will attempt this? I could at once safely do, (or you could safely do without me) whatever<span class="ptr"><a name="6_37_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_37_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> you and he agree upon. There is absolutely no reason why you should not agree. Yours as ever</p>
<p>A. LINCOLN</p>
<p>P.S. I forgot to say that Hon. James S. Rollins, M.C. from one of the Missouri Districts wishes that, upon his personal responsibility, Rev. John M. Robinson, of Columbia, Mo. James L. Matthews of Boone county, Mo, and James L. Stephens, also of Boone county, Mo. may be allowed to return to their respective homes. Major Rollins leaves with me very strong papers from the neighbors of these men, whom he says he knows to be true men. He also says he has many constituents who he thinks are rightfully exiled; but that he thinks these three should be allowed to return. Please look into the case, and oblige Major Rollins if you consistently can.<span class="ptr"><a name="6_37_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_37_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[4]</a></span> Yours truly A.

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS copy, DLC-RTL. This letter is misdated July 5, 1863, in Hertz, II, 899. As printed in the <span class="rend-i">Official Records</span> (I, XXII, II, 17-18) it carries the subscription ``(Copy sent to Governor Gamble),'' and we may infer from General Curtis' reply (<span class="rend-i">infra</span>) that as of January 15, he had not received the original. On December 31, 1862, Governor Gamble telegraphed Lincoln as follows: ``I have stopped all assessments of Enrolled Militia. Please order by telegraph the suspension of all assessments by United States officers. Great distress is produced.'' (OR, I, XXII, I, 888). On January 3, 1863, Lincoln's interview with James E. Yeatman, Giles F. Filley, and George P. Strong took place (see postscript to Lincoln's letter to Curtis, January 2, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>). On January 4 six members of<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;38</span></p>
<p>Congress from Missouri petitioned Lincoln to order a discontinuance of the military assessments ``as now all penalties for violations of the law, can be enforced in the civil tribunals in that State.''</p>
<p>On January 15, Curtis replied as follows:</p>
<p>``I had the honor to see a letter addressed to me, but sent to Governor Gamble, of the 5th instant . . . relating to . . . affairs in this State, which you say are giving you much trouble. . . .</p>
<p>``In my interview with Governor Gamble, and in reference to persons charging him with selfish and ambitious motives, and doubts as to his fidelity, the Governor expressed his regrets, and evinced generous sentiments of loyalty. . . . I think with you that Governor Gamble is loyal, and I do not see any occasion for us to differ, except it may be as to some measures. . . . He goes for you and our country and some of your measures. I go for all. . . . There may be frauds, such as you name, but I doubt it. No assessment committee could commit such a fraud as you name with impunity. . . . On matters concerning the degree and direction of force against rebels, I am appealed to as the supposed head of military power in this vicinity. On complaints of too much severity, the Governor and Your Excellency are appealed to, and we do not, therefore, . . . always see both sides. As to banishments, the Governor goes further than I. . . . As to the cases named by Mr. Rollins, I will examine, and write to him. They must stand on their own merits, not on his; but I shall have due deference to his opinion as to the safety of the release. As I intimated in a former letter, I only fear some conflict with the Governor in regard to Enrolled Militia and regular volunteers. I command the volunteers, but the Enrolled Militia, it is claimed, can only be commanded by the Governor. . . .'' (OR, I, XXII, II, 42-43).</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; AES-IHi; AES copy, DLC-RTL. Lincoln's endorsement is written on an official copy of Halleck's letter to Burnside of January 7, 1863. The autograph copy of the endorsement is written on the back of Burnside's letter to Lincoln of January 5, 1863, and is headed ``Answered by indorsement on copy of Gen. Halleck's letter as follows.''</p>
<p>On January 5, Burnside tendered his resignation ``as Major General of Volunteers'' and wrote Lincoln as follows:</p>
<p>``Since my return to the Army I have become more than ever convinced that the General Officers of this command are almost unanimously opposed to another crossing of the river; but I am still of the opinion that the crossing should be attempted, &amp; I have accordingly issued orders to the Engineers and Artilery to prepare for it. There is much hazzard in it as there always is in the majority of Military Movements, and I cannot begin the movement without giving you notice of it, particularly as I know so little of the effect that it may have upon other movements of distant armies. The influence of your telegraph the other day is still upon me, and has impressed me with the idea that there are many parts of the problem which influence you that are not<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;47</span>
known to me. In order to relieve you from all embarassment in my case, I enclose with this my resignation of my commission of Major General of Volunteers which you can have accepted, if my movement is not in accordance with the views of yourself, and your military advisers. I have taken the liberty to write to you personally upon this subject because it was necessary as I learn from Genl Halleck for you to approve of my general plan written at Warrenton, before I could commence the movement, and I think it quite as necessary that you should know of the important movement I am about to make---particularly as it will have to be made in opposition to the views of nearly all my General Officers, &amp; after the receipt of a dispatch from you informing me of the opinion of some of them who had visited you.</p>
<p>``I beg leave to say that my resignation is not sent in, in any spirit of insubordination, but as I before said simply to relieve you of any embarrassment in changing commanders where lack of confidence may have rendered it necessary.</p>
<p>``The bearer of this will bring me any answer, or I should be glad to hear from you by telegraph in cipher.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>As printed in the <span class="rend-i">Official Records</span> (I, XXI, 944-45) Burnside's letter has an additional paragraph, third from the last, which is reproduced from ``Burnside's copy of this letter, but is not in that received by the President,'' as follows:</p>
<p>``In conversation with you on New Year's morning, I was led to express some opinions which I afterward felt it my duty to place on paper, and to express them verbally to the gentlemen of whom we were speaking, which I did in your presence after handing you the letter. You were not disposed then, as I saw, to retain this letter, and I took it back, but I now return it to you for record, if you wish it.''</p>
<p>The copy of Halleck's letter to Burnside of January 7, which bears Lincoln's original endorsement, reads as follows:</p>
<p>``In all my communications and interviews with you since you took command of the Army of the Potomac, I have advised a forward movement across the Rappahannock. At our interview at Warrenton, I urged that you should cross by the fords above Fredericksburg rather than to fall down to that place, and, when I left you at Warrenton, it was understood that at least a considerable part of your army would cross by the fords, and I so represented to the President. It was this modification of the plan proposed by you, that I telegraphed you had received his approval. When the attempt at Fredericksburg was abandoned, I advised you to renew the attempt at some other point, either in whole or in part to turn the enemy's works, or to threaten their wings or communications; in other words, to keep the enemy occupied till a favorable opportunity offered to strike a decisive blow. I particularly advised you to use your cavalry and light artillery upon his communications, and attempt to cut off his supplies and engage him at an advantage.</p>
<p>``In all our interviews I have urged that our first object was, not Richmond, but the defeat or scattering of Lee's army, which threatened Washington and the line of the Upper Potomac. I now recur to these things simply to remind you of the general views which I have expressed, and which I still hold.</p>
<p>``The circumstances of the case, however, have somewhat changed since the early part of November. The chances of an extended line of operations are now, on account of the advanced season, much less than then. But the chances are still in our favor to meet and defeat the enemy on the Rappahannock, if we can effect a crossing in a position where we can meet the enemy on favorable or even equal terms. I therefore still advise a movement against him. The character of that movement, however, must depend upon circumstances which may change any day and almost any hour. If the enemy should concentrate his forces at the place you have selected for a crossing, make it a feint and try another place. Again, the circumstances at the time may be such as to render<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;48</span>
an attempt to cross the entire army not advisable. In that case theory suggests that, while the enemy concentrates at that point, advantages can be gained by crossing smaller forces at other points, to cut off his lines, destroy his communication, and capture his rear guards, outposts, &amp;c. The great object is to occupy the enemy, to prevent his making large detachments or distant raids, and to injure him all you can with the least injury to yourself. If this can be best accomplished by feints of a general crossing and detached real crossings, take that course; if by an actual general crossing, with feints on other points, adopt that course. There seems to me to be many reasons why a crossing at some point should be attempted. It will not do to keep your large army inactive. As you yourself admit, it devolves on you to decide upon the time, place, and character of the crossing which you may attempt. I can only advise that an attempt be made, and as early as possible.'' (OR, I, XXI, 953-54).</p>

<p>My dear Sir Your interesting communication by the hand of Major Scates is received. I never did ask more, nor ever was willing to accept less, than for all the States, and the people thereof, to take and hold their places, and their rights, in the Union, under the Constitution of the United States. For this alone have I felt authorized to struggle; and I seek neither more nor less now. Still, to use a coarse, but an expressive figure, broken eggs can not be mended. I have issued the emancipation proclamation, and I can not retract it.</p>
<p>After the commencement of hostilities I struggled nearly a year and a half to get along without touching the ``institution''; and when finally I conditionally determined to touch it, I gave a hundred<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;49</span>
days fair notice of my purpose, to all the States and people, within which time they could have turned it wholly aside, by simply again becoming good citizens of the United States. They chose to disregard it, and I made the peremptory proclamation on what appeared to me to be a military necessity. And being made, it must stand. As to the States not included in it, of course they can have their rights in the Union as of old. Even the people of the states included, if they choose, need not to be hurt by it. Let them adopt systems of apprenticeship for the colored people, conforming substantially to the most approved plans of gradual emancipation; and, with the aid they can have from the general government, they may be nearly as well off, in this respect, as if the present trouble had not occurred, and much better off than they can possibly be if the contest continues persistently.</p>
<p>As to any dread of my having a ``purpose to enslave, or exterminate, the whites of the South,'' I can scarcely believe that such dread exists. It is too absurd. I believe you can be my personal witness that no man is less to be dreaded for undue severity, in any case.</p>
<p>If the friends you mention really wish to have peace upon the old terms, they should act at once. Every day makes the case more difficult. They can so act, with entire safety, so far as I am concerned.</p>
<p>I think you would better not make this letter public; but you may rely confidently on my standing by whatever I have said in it. Please write me if any thing more comes to light. Yours very truly</p>

<p>The Secretary of State has submitted to me a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 5th. instant, which has been delivered to him, and which is in the following words:</p>
<p>``Resolved, That the Secretary of State be requested to communicate to this House if not in his judgment incompatible with the public interest, why our Minister in New Granada has not presented his credentials to the actual government of that country.

had, if any, with General Herran as the Representative of Ospina's Government in New Granada since it went out of existence.''</p>
<p>On the 12th. day of December 1846, a treaty of amity, peace and concord was concluded between the United States of America and the Republic of New Granada, which is still in force. On the 7th. day of December 1847, General Pedro Alcantara Herran, who had been duly accredited, was received here as the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of that Republic. On the 30th. day of August, 1849, Senor Don Rafael Rivas was received by this Government as Charge d'Affaires of the same Republic. On the 5th. day of December, 1851, a Consular Convention was concluded between that Republic and the United States, which Treaty was signed on behalf of the Republic of Granada by the same Senor Rivas. This treaty is still in force. On the 27th. of April, 1852, Senor Don Victoriano de Diego Paredes was received as Charge d'Affaires of the Republic of New Granada. On the 20th. of June, 1855, General Pedro Alcantara Herran was again received as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, duly accredited by the Republic of New Granada, and he has ever since remained, under the same credentials, as the representative of that Republic near the Government of the United States. On the 10th. of September, 1857, a Claims Convention was concluded between the United States and the Republic of Granada. This Convention is still in force, and has in part been executed. In May, 1858, the Constitution of the Republic was remodelled and the nation assumed the political title of ``The Granadian Confederacy.'' This fact was formally announced to this Government, but without any change in their representative here. Previous to the fourth day of March, 1861, a revolutionary war against the Republic of New Granada, which had thus been recognized and treated with by the United States, broke out in New Granada, assuming to set up a new Government under the name of the United States of Columbia. This war has had various vicissitudes, sometimes favorable, sometimes adverse to the revolutionary movement. The revolutionary organization has hitherto been simply a military provisionary power, and no definitive constitution of Government has yet been established in New Granada in place of that organized by the Constitution of 1858. The Minister of the United States to the Granadian Confederacy, who was appointed on the 29th. day of May, 1861, was directed, in view of the occupation of the capital by the revolutionary party and of the uncertainty of the civil war, not to present his credentials to either the Government of the Granadian Confederacy or to the provisional Military Government,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;58</span>
but to conduct his affairs informally as is customary in such cases, and to report the progress of events and await the instructions of this Government. The advices which have been received from him, have not hitherto been sufficiently conclusive to determine me to recognize the revolutionary Government. General Herran being here with full authority from the Government of New Granada, which had been so long recognized by the United States, I have not received any representative from the Revolutionary government, which has not yet been recognized, because such a proceeding would in itself be an act of recognition. Official communications have been had on various incidental and occasional questions with General Herran as the Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary of the Granadian Confederacy---but in no other character; no definitive measure or proceeding has resulted from these communications, and a communication of them at present would not, in my judgment, be compatible with the public interest.</p>

<div class="textindentlevelx">
<div class="opener">January 17, 1863</div>
<p>To the Senate and House of Representatives:</p>
<p>I have signed the Joint Resolution to provide for the immediate payment of the army and navy of the United States, passed by the House of Representatives on the 14th, and by the Senate on the 15th instant.</p>
<p>The Joint Resolution is a simple authority, amounting however, under existing circumstances, to a direction to the Secretary of the Treasury to make an additional issue of one hundred millions of dollars in United States notes if so much money is needed for the payment of the army and navy.</p>
<p>My approval is given in order that every possible facility may be afforded for the prompt discharge of all arrears of pay due to our soldiers and our sailors.</p>
<p>While giving this approval, however, I think it my duty to express my sincere regret that it has been found necessary to authorize<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;61</span>
so large an additional issue of United States notes, when this circulation, and that of the suspended banks together have become already so redundant as to increase prices beyond real values, thereby augmenting the cost of living to the injury of labor, and the cost of supplies to the injury of the whole country.</p>
<p>It seems very plain that continued issues of United States notes, without any check to the issues of suspended banks, and without adequate provision for the raising of money by loans, and for founding the issues so as to keep them within due limits, must soon produce disastrous consequences. And this matter appears to me so important that I feel bound to avail myself of this occasion to ask the special attention of Congress to it.</p>
<p>That Congress has power to regulate the currency of the country, can hardly admit of doubt; and that a judicious measure to prevent the deterioration of this currency, by a reasonable taxation of bank circulation or otherwise is needed, seems equally clear. Independently of this general consideration, it would be unjust to the people at large, to exempt banks, enjoying the special privilege of circulation, from their just proportion of the public burdens.</p>
<p>In order to raise money by way of loans most easily and cheaply, it is clearly necessary to give every possible support to the public credit. To that end, a uniform currency, in which taxes, subscriptions to loans, and all other ordinary public dues, as well as all private dues may be paid, is almost, if not quite indispensable. Such a currency can be furnished by banking associations, organized under a general act of Congress, as suggested in my message at the beginning of the present session. The securing of this circulation, by the pledge of United States bonds, as therein suggested, would still further facilitate loans, by increasing the present and causing a future demand for such bonds.</p>
<p>In view of the actual financial embarrassments of the government, and of the greater embarrassments sure to come, if the necessary means of relief be not afforded, I feel that I should not perform my duty by a simple announcement of my approval of the Joint Resolution which proposes relief only by increasing circulation, without expressing my earnest desire that measures, such in substances as those I have just referred to, may receive the early sanction of Congress.</p>
<p>By such measures, in my opinion, will payment be most certainly secured, not only to the army and navy, but to all honest creditors of the government, and satisfactory provision made for future demands on the treasury. ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

<div class="textindentlevelx">
<div class="opener">Executive Mansion, Washington,<br>
To the workingmen of Manchester: January 19, 1863.</div>
<p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the address and resolutions which you sent to me on the eve of the new year.</p>
<p>When I came, on the fourth day of March, 1861, through a free and constitutional election, to preside in the government of the United States, the country was found at the verge of civil war. Whatever might have been the cause, or whosoever the fault, one duty paramount to all others was before me, namely, to maintain and preserve at once the Constitution and the integrity of the federal republic. A conscientious purpose to perform this duty is a key to all the measures of administration which have been, and<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;64</span>
to all which will hereafter be pursued. Under our form of government, and my official oath, I could not depart from this purpose if I would. It is not always in the power of governments to enlarge or restrict the scope of moral results which follow the policies that they may deem it necessary for the public safety, from time to time, to adopt.</p>
<p>I have understood well that the duty of self-preservation rests solely with the American people. But I have at the same time been aware that favor or disfavor of foreign nations might have a material influence in enlarging and prolonging the struggle with disloyal men in which the country is engaged. A fair examination of history has seemed to authorize a belief that the past action and influences of the United States were generally regarded as having been beneficient towards mankind. I have therefore reckoned upon the forbearance of nations. Circumstances, to some of which you kindly allude, induced me especially to expect that if justice and good faith should be practiced by the United States, they would encounter no hostile influence on the part of Great Britain. It is now a pleasant duty to acknowledge the demonstration you have given of your desire that a spirit of peace and amity towards this country may prevail in the councils of your Queen, who is respected and esteemed in your own country only more than she is by the kindred nation which has its home on this side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>I know and deeply deplore the sufferings which the workingmen at Manchester and in all Europe are called to endure in this crisis. It has been often and studiously represented that the attempt to overthrow this government, which was built upon the foundation of human rights, and to substitute for it one which should rest exclusively on the basis of human slavery, was likely to obtain the favor of Europe. Through the actions of our disloyal citizens the workingmen of Europe have been subjected to a severe trial, for the purpose of forcing their sanction to that attempt. Under these circumstances, I cannot but regard your decisive utterance upon the question as an instance of sublime Christian heroism which has not been surpassed in any age or in any country. It is, indeed, an energetic and reinspiring assurance of the inherent power of truth and of the ultimate and universal triumph of justice, humanity, and freedom. I do not doubt that the sentiments you have expressed will be sustained by your great nation, and, on the other hand, I have no hesitation in assuring you that they will excite admiration, esteem, and the most reciprocal feelings of friendship among the American people. I hail this interchange of<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;65</span>
sentiment, therefore, as an augury that, whatever else may happen, whatever misfortune may befall your country or my own, the peace and friendship which now exist between the two nations will be, as it shall be my desire to make them, perpetual.</p>

My dear Sir Washington, D.C. Jan. 20, 1863.</div>
<p>Yours of January 12th. stating the distressed condition of the people in South-West Missouri, and urging the completion of the Railroad to Springfield, is just received. Of course I deplore the distress of the people in that section &amp; elsewhere. Nor is the thought of extending the railroad, new to me. But the military necessity for it, is not so patent, but that Congress would try to restrain me in some way, were I to attempt it. I am very glad to believe that the late military operations in Missouri and Arkans[as] are at least, promising of repose to South West Missouri.</p>
<p>Yours very truly A. LINCOLN</p>

It would complete the conquest of Mo and lay all Arkansas in our power. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).

<p>``I have determined, at whatever personal cost to myself, to address . . . you, upon a subject of the deepest interest. . . .</p>
<p>``I charge Maj. Genl. Henry W. Halleck with wilful contempt of superior authority, and with utter incompetency for the extraordinary and vital functions with which he is charged as Genl-in-Chief. . . .</p>
<p>``I charge him with contempt of authority in this: That in violation of the order made by the Secretary of War, under your personal direction, bearing date of October 21, 1862, assigning me to the command of the proposed `Miss. River Expedition,' he set me aside for . . . Maj. Genl. U.S. Grant---whom he privately authorized to detach troops to Memphis, to form part of the Expedition, prior to the issue of the public order, assigning me to its command. Also in this: That, although the order, issued by the Secretary of War, was made in the presence of the Genl.-in-Chief . . . he has contumaciously refused to recognize me in the relations contemplated . . .</p>
<p>``I charge him with incompetency on many grounds: 1st, For want of eminence in any profession, or calling, previous to his appointment as Maj. Genl. . . .</p>
<p>``Without ever having fought a battle, he curtailed the success of our arms at Fort Henry. . . . Before Corinth, . . . he permitted the enemy to escape. . . . Since he assumed the functions of General-in-Chief, scarcely anything but disaster has marked the experiences of our arms. . . .</p>
<p>``How can the country be saved in its dire extremity, with such a Chief at the head of our armies! . . .</p>
<p>``Without genius, justice, generosity, or policy, his continuance in command will not only involve continual new levies to fill up the wasting ranks . . . but must be attended by accumulating disaster. . . .</p>

<p>On January 21, Halleck further extended General Grant's authority and explained the revocation of Grant's order expelling Jews from his department:</p>
<p>``General: The President has directed that so much of Arkansas as you may desire to control be temporarily attached to your department. This will give you control of both banks of the river.</p>
<p>``In your operations down the Mississippi you must not rely too confidently upon any direct co-operation of General Banks and the lower flotilla, as it is possible that they may not be able to pass or reduce Port Hudson. They, however, will do everything in their power to form a junction with you at Vicksburg. If they should not be able to effect this, they will at least occupy a portion of the enemy's forces and prevent them from re-enforcing Vicksburg. I hope, however, that they will do still better and be able to join you.</p>
<p>``It may be proper to give you some explanation of the revocation of your order expelling all Jews from your department. The President has no objection to your expelling traitors and Jew peddlers, which, I suppose, was the object of your order; but, as it in terms proscribed an entire religious class, some of whom are fighting in our ranks, the President deemed it necessary to revoke it.''

There was no understanding that any of these girls should be delivered up to their masters. If they had been white I should have given the same order. . . .</p>

<p>``I have just been shown a letter from the President to Brig. Steele stating that his name had been withheld from the Senate for promotion in consequence of charges that had been made against him for returning fugitive slaves to their Masters.</p>
<p>``Gen. Steele is one of our very best soldiers. . . . He is in every sense a soldier. . . . No matter how far any policy of the Government might vary from his individual views he would conform to it. . . . Besides I have never heard him express an opinion against any policy of the administration and know he would do nothing to weaken the power of the President. . . .</p>
<p>``I hope the President &amp; the Senate will be disabused of any opinion they may have formed prejudicial to Gen. Steele. . . .'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid.</span>).</p>

My dear Sir: Washington, [January 23?] 1863.</div>
<p>In superseding you, by returning Gen. Butler to command the Department of the Gulf, I have trusted that you will not understand me as being even indifferent to your feelings and your honor. I would be as careful of yours as of my own.</p>
<p>I have issued the proclamation, which, like most measures has two sides to its effects. What is evil in effect we are already en during, and we must have the counterpart of it. For this last, as I think, there is no such place as Louisiana, and no such man as Gen. Butler. But to make the most of both, he must go with heart and will; and having been relieved from that Department it is a great point with him to be restored to it. In beginning the peculiar work alluded to there should not be another hour's delay. Hence I send him at once. I sincerely hope the Mississippi may be opened by the time Gen. Butler reaches New-Orleans; but whether it<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;74</span>
shall be or not, he must go forward without more delay. That you shall make your independent expedition into Texas is still intended; but it can not be made so long as your force is needed on the Mississippi; and while needed there, it is my purpose that you retain the immediate command of it in it's operation, although you are to report to Gen. Butler after his arrival. When your force, or a substantial and sufficient part of it can be spared from the Mississippi, you are to go to Texas with a department independent of Gen. Butler. His orders and instructions are drawn up with a view to, and in conformity with all this.</p>

<p>I have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac. Of course I have done this upon what appear to me to be sufficient reasons. And yet I think it best for you to know that there are some things in regard to which, I am not quite satisfied with you. I believe you to be a brave and a skilful soldier, which, of course, I like. I also believe you do not mix politics with your profession, in which you are right. You have confidence in yourself, which is a valuable, if not an indispensable quality. You are ambitious, which, within reasonable bounds, does good rather than harm. But I think that during Gen. Burnside's command of the Army, you have taken counsel of your ambition, and thwarted him as much as you could, in which you did a great wrong to the country, and to a most meritorious and honorable brother officer. I have heard, in such way as to believe it, of your recently saying that both the Army and the Government needed a Dictator. Of course it was not <span class="rend-i">for</span> this, but in spite of it, that I have given you the command. Only those generals who gain successes, can set up dictators. What I now ask of you is military success, and I will risk<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;79</span>
the dictatorship. The government will support you to the utmost of it's ability, which is neither more nor less than it has done and will do for all commanders. I much fear that the spirit which you have aided to infuse into the Army, of criticising their Commander, and withholding confidence from him, will now turn upon you. I shall assist you as far as I can, to put it down. Neither you, nor Napoleon, if he were alive again, could get any good out of an army, while such a spirit prevails in it.</p>

<p>``The order from the War Department, assigning Gen. Schurz to the command of the Eleventh Corps has been received and promulgated by me. It was my understanding and that of the officers of the Eleventh Corps that Gen. Schurz was only to take the command of the Corps in the event of his becoming a Major General; and also that Gen. Stahel was, at the same time, to be promoted and assigned to the command of a Reserve Corps of Cavalry attached to the Grand Reserve Division.</p>
<p>``Under existing circumstances there is much dissatisfaction among the officers, which might be damaging to our interests in case of a battle, and Gen. Stahel feels humiliated by this arrangement, since it gives him a command inferior to that he has all along had---the command of a Division together with the Cavalry of the Corps. According to the order of the War Dept. he is now assigned to the command of the Cavalry alone, which is not so strong as it was when he had the command of his Division together with the Cavalry of the Corps.</p>

<p>``I believe that, in regard to Genl. Stahel and Genl. Schurz, the former is entitled by seniority to succeed me in the command of the 11th Corps, and so I represented my convictions to Genl. Burnside, and intended to be so understood by Your Excellency.</p>
<p>``In order to accommodate both of these officers, and because I believed a Cavalry Corps would be of great advantage . . . I recommended that, if such a Corps could be organized, Genl. Stahel could superintend its organization and take command of it, while Genl. Schurz could . . . command . . . the 11th Corps. . . . As, however, according to your endorsement . . . it seems not convenient to organize such a Cavalry force at present, I think it my duty . . . to renew my recommendation that Genl. Stahel succeed me in the command of the 11th Corps. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>

<p>``General [Andrew A.] Humphreys is the general that behaved so gallantly at Fredericksburg, and when I spoke to you of him you said he ought to be rewarded by promotion to rank of major-general, and I hope it will be done. . . .'' (OR, I, XXI, 1006).</p>
<p>On March 28, 1863, Humphreys wrote Secretary Stanton asking for a court of inquiry in regard to a note of censure which he received from Major General Halleck, September 13, 1862, ``I make this request because after having been strongly recommended for promotion for services in the field by Major-General Burnside, my promotion has not taken place. . . .'' (OR, I, XIX, I, 368). Halleck endorsed this complaint with the notation that ``As General Halleck did not oppose General Humphrey's promotion, but on the contrary supported General Burnside's recommendation for such promotion, the whole motive of General Humphreys' complaints falls to the ground.'' (OR, I, LI, I, 1000). Humphreys' promotion to major general was sent to the Senate in a list under date of December 31, 1863, but was not confirmed by the Senate until May 12, 1864.</p>

Can you meet me at Harrisburg?'' (OR, III, III, 23). Peace Democrats were advocating a Northwest Confederacy. The Indiana legislature had gone Democratic in the 1862 elections, and Morton was having a great deal of trouble. On February 9, he sent Lincoln by Robert Dale Owen a letter outlining the plans of the Democrats to end the war by whatever means, to recognize the Confederacy, and to propose a reunion leaving out the New England States. The letter also dealt with the secret societies which were being organized with the avowed purpose of sabotaging the Union.</p>

<p>As those sentiments are manifestly the enduring support of the free institutions of England, so I am sure also that they constitute the only reliable basis for free institutions throughout the world.</p>
<p>The resources, advantages, and powers of the American people are very great, and they have, consequently, succeeded to equally great responsibilities. It seems to have devolved upon them to test whether a government, established on the principles of human<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;89</span>

<p>Abraham Lincoln,</p>
<p>President of the United States of America.</p>
<p>To His Excellency Senor Don Bartolome Mitre,</p>
<p>President of the Argentine Republic.</p>
<p>Great and Good Friend: I have received the letter which Your Excellency has addressed to me under date of the 23d. October, last, announcing your election to the Presidency of the Republic by the free suffrages of your fellow-citizens.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;95</span>I assure Your Excellency that this event has inspired me with the liveliest gratification. After so many years of discord and strife the Provinces of the Argentine Confederation have buried their jealousies and again present themselves to the world as a united nation having a common interest and a common destiny.</p>
<p>No one knows better than Your Excellency that it has been the uniform desire and effort of this Government so far as it could properly do so by the friendly offices of its Ministers in the Plata, to promote conciliation and to effect the consolidation which has happily been accomplished.</p>
<p>I congratulate the nation and Your Excellency upon this result, and upon the elevation of Your Excellency to the Chief Magistracy of the reunited Republic. And I do not doubt that the earnest patriotism and enlightened statesmanship of Your Excellency will speedily obliterate all painful remembrances of the past and inspire the people of the nation to give you a hearty and unanimous support in the development of their best interests.</p>
<p>Sincerely reciprocating Your Excellency's sentiments of friendship for this Government and people and praying God to have your Excellency always in His most holy keeping, I am your Good Friend, ABRAHAM LINCOLN.</p>
<p>By the President:</p>
<p>WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.</p>

<p>On the 4th of September, 1862, Commander George Henry Preble, U.S. Navy, then senior officer in command of the Naval force off the harbor of Mobile, was guilty of inexcusable neglect in permitting the armed steamer Oreto, in open daylight, to run the blockade. For his omission to perform his whole duty on that occasion and the injury thereby inflicted on the service and the country, his name was stricken from the list of Naval officers and he was dismissed the service.</p>
<p>Since his dismissal earnest application has been made for his restoration to his former position by Senators and Naval officers, on the ground that his fault was an error of judgment, and that the example in his case has already had its effect in preventing a repetition of similar neglect.</p>
<p>I therefore, on this application and representation, and in consideration of his previous fair record, do hereby nominate George Henry Preble to be a commander in the Navy, from the 16th July, 1862, to take rank on the active list next after Commander Edward Donaldson, and to fill a vacancy occasioned by the death of Commander J.

Wainwright.<span class="ptr"><a name="6_102_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_102_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> FOOTNOTES}&gt;(2) ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

<p>On the 24th August, 1861, Commander Roger Perry, U.S. Navy. was dismissed from the service under a misapprehension in regard to his loyalty to the Government, from the circumstance that several oaths were transmitted to him and the Navy Department failed to receive any recognition of them. After his dismissal, and upon<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;103</span>
his assurance that the oath failed to reach him and his readiness to execute it, he was recommissioned to his original position on the 4th September following. On the same day, 4th September, he was ordered to command the sloop-of-war Vandalia; on the 22d this order was revoked and he was ordered to duty in the Mississippi squadron, and on the 23d January, 1862, was detached sick, and has since remained unemployed. The Advisory Board, under the act of 16th July, 1862, did not recommend him for further promotion.</p>
<p>This last commission having been issued during the recess of the Senate expired at the end of the succeeding session, 17 July. 1862, from which date, not having been nominated to the Senate. he ceased to be a commander in the Navy.</p>
<p>To correct the omission to nominate this officer to the Senate at its last session, I now nominate Commander Roger Perry to be a commander in the Navy, from the 14th September, 1855, to take his relative position on the list of commanders not recommended for further promotion.

<p>This morning the West-Virginia delegation call and say that the enemy contemplate invading &amp; over-running them, in the early Spring; and that, for this object, among other things they are building a plank-road from Staunton to Beverly.

<div class="opener">To the Senate of the United States: February 25, 1863</div>
<p>I nominate Passed Midshipman Samuel Pearce and Nathaniel T. West, now on the retired list, to be ensigns in the Navy on the retired list.</p>
<p>These nominations are made in conformity with the 4th section of the act to amend an act entitled ``An act to promote the efficiency of the Navy,'' approved 16 January, 1857, and are induced by the following considerations:</p>
<p>The pay of a passed midshipman on the retired list as fixed by the ``Act for the better organization of the military establishment,'' approved 3d August, 1861, amounted, including rations, to $788 per annum. By the ``Act to establish and equalize the grade of line officers of the U.S. Navy,'' approved 16 July, 1862, the grade or rank of passed midshipman, which was the next below that of master, was discontinued and that of ensign was established, being now the next grade below that of master and the only grade in the line list between those of master and midshipman. The same act fixes the pay of officers on the retired list, omitting the grade of<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;117</span>
passed midshipman, and prohibits the allowance of rations to retired officers. The effect of this was to reduce the pay of a passed midshipman on the retired-list from $788 to $350 per annum, or less than half of previous rate.</p>
<p>This was no doubt an unintended result of the law, operating exclusively on the two passed midshipmen then on the retired-list, and their promotion or transfer to the equivalent grade of ensign would not completely indemnify them, the pay of an ensign on the retired-list being only $500 per annum. It is the only relief however which is deemed within the intention of the existing laws, and it is the more willingly recommended in this case as there is nothing in the character of the officers to be relieved which would make it objectionable. These are the only cases of the kind.</p>

Marchant was engaged in painting the portrait of Lincoln which is now owned by the Union League Club of Philadelphia. The genesis of this portrait is explained by John W.

Marchant, who ``has been empowered by a large body of your personal and political friends to paint your picture for the Hall of American Independence. . . .'' (DLC-RTL). Presumably Edward D.

<p>``Enclosed you will find Eight hundred and sixty eight dollars which came by in a dishonest manner and which I return to the United States through you</p>

<p>And I do hereby declare and proclaim, that all soldiers now absent from their respective regiments without leave, who shall, on or before the first day of April, 1863, report themselves at any rendezvous designated by the General Orders of the War Department number fifty-eight, hereto annexed, may be restored to their respective regiments without punishment, except the forfeiture of pay and allowances during their absence; and all who do not return within the time above specified shall be arrested as deserters, and punished as the law provides.</p>
<p>And whereas evil disposed and disloyal persons at sundry places have enticed and procured soldiers to desert and absent themselves from their regiments, thereby weakening the strength of the armies and prolonging the war, giving aid and comfort to the enemy, and cruelly exposing the gallant and faithful soldiers remaining in the ranks to increased hardships and danger, I do therefore call upon all patriotic and faithful citizens to oppose and resist the<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;133</span>

<div class="textindentlevelx">
<div class="opener">Executive Mansion,<br>
Major General Rosecrans Washington, March 17, 1863.</div>
<p>My dear Sir. I have just received your telegram saying that ``The Secy. of War telegraphed after the battle of Stone River'' `Anything you &amp; your command want, you can have,''' and then specifying several things you have requested, and have not received.</p>
<p>The promise of the Secretary, as you state it, is certainly pretty broad; nevertheless it accords with the feeling of the whole government here towards you. I know not a single enemy of yours here. Still the promise must have a reasonable construction. We know you will not purposely make an unreasonable request; nor persist in one after it shall appear to be such.</p>
<p>Now, as to the matter of a Pay-Master. You desired one to be permanently attached to your Army, and, as I understand, desired that Major Larned should be the man. This was denied you; and you seem to think it was denied, partly to disoblige you, and partly to disoblige Major Larned---the latter, as you suspect, at the instance of Paymaster-General Andrews. On the contrary, the Secretary of War assures me the request was refused on no personal ground, whatever, but because to grant it, would derange, and substantially break up the whole pay-system as now organized, and so organized on very full consideration, and sound reason as believed. There is powerful temptation in money; and it was and is believed that nothing can prevent the Pay-Masters speculating upon the soldiers, but a system by which each is to pay certain regiments so soon after he has notice that he is to pay those particular regiments that he has no time or opportunity to lay plans<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;139</span>
for speculating upon them. This precaution is all lost, if Paymasters respectively are to serve permanently with the same regiments, and pay them over and over during the war. No special application of this has been intended to be made to Major Larned, or to your Army.</p>
<p>And as to Gen. Andrews, I have, in another connection, felt a little agrieved, at what seemed to me, his implicit following the advice and suggestions of Major Larned---so ready are we all to cry out, and ascribe motives, when our own toes are pinched.</p>
<p>Now, as to your request that your Commission should date from December 1861. Of course you expected to <span class="rend-i">gain</span> something by this; but you should remember that precisely so much as you should gain by it others would lose by it. If the thing you sought had been exclusively ours, we would have given it cheerfully; but being the right of other men, we having a merely arbitrary power over it, the taking it from them and giving it to you, became a more delicate matter, and more deserving of consideration. Truth to speak, I do not appreciate this matter of rank on paper, as you officers do. The world will not forget that you fought the battle of ``Stone River'' and it will never care a fig whether you rank Gen. Grant on paper, or he so, ranks you.</p>
<p>As to the appointment of an aid contrary to your wishes, I knew nothing of it until I received your despatch; and the Secretary of War tells me he has known nothing of it, but will trace it out. The examination of course will extend to the case of R. S. Thoms, whom you say you wish appointed.</p>
<p>And now be assured, you wrong both yourself and us, when you even suspect there is not the best disposition on the part of us all here to oblige you. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADfS, DLC-RTL. Rosecrans' telegram of March 16 is as follows: ``The Secretary of War telegraphed after the battle of Stone's River: `Anything you and your command want you can have.' I asked that paymasters like other staff officers, should serve with the troops in the field. It was not granted. I then asked as a personal favor that my commission should date from December, 1861. It was not granted. I then asked that Major [Charles T.] Larned, chief paymaster of this department, might be left here, and not removed, as I have reason to believe he has been, to gratify the spleen of Colonel [Timothy P.] Andrews, who hates him on account of his dislike of the old Colonel [Benjamin F.] Larned. That was refused. When I asked that the major might stay to expedite the payment of the troops, Major [Charles M.] Terrell being then sick, that was not granted. Now I find an aide has been appointed, whom, having once recommended, I requested not to be appointed, because he went off on a spree the very night after I told him I had recommended him, hoping that he would at least quit drinking.</p>
<p>``After telegraphing the withdrawal, and explaining to his brother-in-law, Col. Donn Piatt, the reason, I nominated R[obert] S. Thoms, esq., a young lawyer of Cincinnati, who, paying his own way, served at the battle of Stone's</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;140</span>River with as much gallantry and effect as any one of the staff. This request was disregarded, and an aide appointed in spite of my request. . . .'' (OR, I, XXIII, II, 146-47).</p>
<p>Rosecrans' appointment as major general took effect as of March 21, 1862, Grant's, as of February 16, 1862. Robert S. Thoms' nomination as captain and aide-de-camp had gone to the Senate under date of February 26, 1863, but the nomination incorrectly gave his name as ``Thomas.'' He was appointed as of April 25, 1863. The appointment of Donn Piatt's brother-in-law, Byron Kirby, as captain and aide-de-camp to Rosecrans was confirmed by the Senate on March 11.</p>

Lyman Guinnip, a dealer in agricultural implements at Danville, Illinois, had served as colonel of the Seventy-ninth Illinois Volunteers from August 28 to October 17, 1862. He was indicted October 24, 1862, together with one C. G. Bradshaw for aiding a slave to escape; John Smith Speed, brother of Joshua, was foreman of the grand jury. The Circuit Court Order Book No. 9 records the disposal of the case in the May term of court, 1863: ``The defendants having in the three foregoing cases deposited in court thirty-six hundred dollars in lieu of bail for their appearance and having failed to appear and suffered a default on motion of Commonwealth by attorney It is ordered that the Trustee of the jury fund pay over to him one thousand and eighty dollars being the thirty percent damages on said forfeiture which was accordingly done.''</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS-F, ISLA. This item is misdated May 20, 1863, in Hertz (II, 895). In an article appearing in the <span class="rend-i">Herald</span> on January 18, 1863, Thomas W. Knox had been highly critical of General William T. Sherman's competence. Having violated Sherman's order prohibiting civilians from accompanying the expedition to Vicksburg, Knox was arrested on Sherman's orders, and tried before a general court-martial at Young's Point, Louisiana, on February 5, for ``giving intelligence to the enemy directly or indirectly'' (found not guilty) and for ``disobedience of orders.'' Found guilty on the latter charge he was sentenced to be banished from the lines, not to return under penalty of imprisonment.</p>
<p>On April 6, Knox presented Lincoln's ``To whom it may concern'' to Sherman, and expressed ``regret at the want of harmony between portions of the army and the press, and the hope that there may be a better feeling in the future. . . .'' (OR, I, XVII, II, 893).</p>
<p>General Grant replied to Knox on April 6, as follows:</p>
<p>``The letter of the President . . . authorizing you to return to these headquarters, and to remain with my consent, or leave if such consent is withheld, has been shown me.</p>
<p>``You came here first in positive violation of an order from General Sherman. Because you were not pleased with his treatment of army followers, who had violated his order, you attempted to break down his influence with his command, and to blast his reputation with the public. You made insinuations against his sanity, and said many things which were untrue, and, so far as your letter had influence, calculated to affect the public service unfavorably.</p>
<p>``General Sherman is one of the ablest soldiers and purest men in the country. You have attacked him and been sentenced to expulsion from this department for the offense. Whilst I would conform to the slightest wish of the President, where it is formed upon a fair representation of both sides of any question, my respect for General Sherman is such that in this case I must decline, unless General Sherman first gives his consent to your remaining.'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid.</span>, p. 894).</p>
<p>General Sherman replied to Knox on April 7:</p>
<p>``Yours of April 6, inclosing a copy of President Lincoln's informal decision in your case, is received.</p>
<p>``I certainly do regret that Generals McClernand and Thayer regard the disobedience of orders emanating from the highest military source and the publication of willful and malicious slanders against their brother officers as mere technical offenses, and notwithstanding the President's indorsement of that conclusion, I cannot so regard it. After having enunciated to me the face that newspaper correspondents were a fraternity bound together by a common interest that must write down all who stood in their way, and that you had to supply the public demand for news, true if possible, but false if your interest demanded it, I cannot be privy to a tacit acknowledgment of the principle.</p>
<p>``Come with a sword or musket in your hand, prepared to share with us our fate in sunshine and storm . . . and I will welcome you . . . but come as you now do, expecting me to ally the reputation and honor of my country and my fellow-soldiers with you, as the representative of the press, which you yourself say makes so slight a difference between truth and falsehood, and my answer is, Never.''

<p>``You have all spoken of the strange sights you see here, among your pale-faced brethren; the very great number of people that you see; the big wigwams; the difference between our people and your own. But you have seen but a very small part of the palefaced people. You may wonder when I tell you that there are people here in this wigwam, now looking at you, who have come from other countries a great deal farther off than you have come.</p>
<p>``We pale-faced people think that this world is a great, round ball, and we have people here of the pale-faced family who have come almost from the other side of it to represent their nations here and conduct their friendly intercourse with us, as you now come from your part of the round ball.''</p>
<p>Here a globe was introduced, and the President, laying his hand upon it, said:</p>
<p>``One of our learned men will now explain to you our notions about this great ball, and show you where you live.''</p>
<p>Professor Henry then gave the delegation a detailed and interesting explanation of the formation of the earth, showing how much of it was water and how much was land; and pointing out the countries with which we had intercourse. He also showed them the position of Washington and that of their own country, from which they had come.</p>
<p>The President then said:</p>
<p>``We have people now present from all parts of the globe---here, and here, and here. There is a great difference between this palefaced people and their red brethren, both as to numbers and the way in which they live. We know not whether your own situation is best for your race, but this is what has made the difference in our way of living.</p>
<p>``The pale-faced people are numerous and prosperous because<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;152</span>
they cultivate the earth, produce bread, and depend upon the products of the earth rather than wild game for a subsistence.</p>
<p>``This is the chief reason of the difference; but there is another. Although we are now engaged in a great war between one another, we are not, as a race, so much disposed to fight and kill one another as our red brethren.</p>
<p>``You have asked for my advice. I really am not capable of advising you whether, in the providence of the Great Spirit, who is the great Father of us all, it is best for you to maintain the habits and customs of your race, or adopt a new mode of life.</p>
<p>``I can only say that I can see no way in which your race is to become as numerous and prosperous as the white race except by living as they do, by the cultivation of the earth.</p>
<p>``It is the object of this Government to be on terms of peace with you, and with all our red brethren. We constantly endeavor to be so. We make treaties with you, and will try to observe them; and if our children should sometimes behave badly, and violate these treaties, it is against our wish.</p>
<p>``You know it is not always possible for any father to have his children do precisely as he wishes them to do.</p>
<p>``In regard to being sent back to your own country, we have an officer, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, who will take charge of that matter, and make the necessary arrangements.''</p>
<p>The President's remarks were received with frequent marks of applause and approbation. ``Ugh,'' ``Aha'' sounded along the line as the interpreter proceeded, and their countenances gave evident tokens of satisfaction.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; Washington <span class="rend-i">Daily Morning Chronicle</span>, March 28, 1863. The <span class="rend-i">Chronicle</span> account of the ceremonies which preceded Lincoln's speech reads in part:</p>
<p>``The Executive Mansion was yesterday morning the scene of a very interesting ceremony. The Indian chiefs now in the city met the President of the United States and had a formal interview with him. The meeting took place in the East room. Quite a number of persons were present, among whom we noticed Secretaries Seward, Chase, and Welles, Daniel S. Dickinson, of New York, Professor Henry, and other celebrated personages. The Indians were all seated on the floor in a line, and around them the spectators formed a ring which, notwithstanding the assiduous yet polite efforts of Mr. Nicolay, was still too contracted to permit all to see the principal actors. The silence, which would seem to be the part of common propriety on such an occasion, was by no means observed by the restless and eager crowd of visitors. Everybody seemed to find some one's bonnet or shoulder in the way, and to think himself or herself entitled to the best and most conspicuous place. The ladies, too, could not refrain from audible comments on the speeches.</p>
<p>``Still everything went off very well. These Indians are fine-looking men. They have all the hard and cruel lines in their faces which we might expect in savages; but they are evidently men of intelligence and force of character. They were both dignified and cordial in their manner, and listened to everything<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;153</span>
with great interest. At half-past eleven the President entered the circle, and each one of the chiefs came forward and shook him by the hand, some of them adding a sort of salaam or salutation by spreading out the hands, and some contenting themselves with a simple shake of the hand and the inevitable `how' of the Indians of the Plains. The following is a list of the chiefs:</p>
<p>``<span class="rend-i">Cheyennes</span>.---Lean Bear, War Bonnet, and Standing Water.</p>
<p>``<span class="rend-i">Kiowais</span>.---Yellow Buffalo, Lone Wolf, Yellow Wolf, White Bull, and Little Heart.</p>
<p>``<span class="rend-i">Arapahoes</span>.---Spotted Wolf and Nevah.</p>
<p>``<span class="rend-i">Comanches</span>.---Pricked Forehead and Ten Bears.</p>
<p>``<span class="rend-i">Apache</span>.---Poor Bear.</p>
<p>``<span class="rend-i">Caddo</span>.---Jacob.</p>
<p>``Mr. Commissioner Dole introduced them. . . .</p>
<p>``The President said: `Say to them I am very glad to see them, and if they have anything to say, it will afford me great pleasure to hear them.' ''</p>
<p>Speeches were made by Lean Bear and Spotted Wolf, through an interpreter, and by Lincoln as reported above.</p>

<p>Hon. Daniel Ullmann, with a commission of Brigadier General, and two or three hundred other gentlemen as officers, goes to your department and reports to you, for the purpose of raising a colored brigade. To now avail ourselves of this element of force, is very important, if not indispensable. I therefore will thank you to help Gen. Ullmann forward with his undertaking, as much, and as rapidly, as you can; and also to carry the general object beyond his particular organization if you find it practicable. The necessity of this is palpable if, as I understand, you are now unable to effect anything with your present force; and which force is soon to be greatly diminished by the expiration of terms of service, as well as by ordinary causes. I shall be very glad if you will take hold of the matter in earnest.</p>
<p>You will receive from the Department a regular order upon this subject. Yours truly A. LINCOLN.</p>

<p>By the President of the United States of America.</p>
<p>A Proclamation.</p>
<p>Whereas, the Senate of the United States, devoutly recognizing the Supreme Authority and just Government of Almighty God, in all the affairs of men and of nations, has, by a resolution, requested the President to designate and set apart a day for National prayer and humiliation:</p>
<p>And whereas it is the duty of nations as well as of men, to own their dependence upon the overruling power of God, to confess their sins and transgressions, in humble sorrow, yet with assured hope that genuine repentance will lead to mercy and pardon; and to recognize the sublime truth, announced in the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history, that those nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord:</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;156</span>And, insomuch as we know that, by His divine law, nations like individuals are subjected to punishments and chastisements in this world, may we not justly fear that the awful calamity of civil war, which now desolates the land, may be but a punishment, inflicted upon us, for our presumptuous sins, to the needful end of our national reformation as a whole People? We have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of Heaven. We have been preserved, these many years, in peace and prosperity. We have grown in numbers, wealth and power, as no other nation has ever grown. But we have forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace, and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us; and we have vainly imagined, in the deceitfulness of our hearts, that all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own. Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God that made us!</p>
<p>It behooves us then, to humble ourselves before the offended Power, to confess our national sins, and to pray for clemency and forgiveness.</p>
<p>Now, therefore, in compliance with the request, and fully concurring in the views of the Senate, I do, by this my proclamation, designate and set apart Thursday, the 30th. day of April, 1863, as a day of national humiliation, fasting and prayer. And I do hereby request all the People to abstain, on that day, from their ordinary secular pursuits, and to unite, at their several places of public worship and their respective homes, in keeping the day holy to the Lord, and devoted to the humble discharge of the religious duties proper to that solemn occasion.</p>
<p>All this being done, in sincerity and truth, let us then rest humbly in the hope authorized by the Divine teachings, that the united cry of the Nation will be heard on high, and answered with blessings, no less than the pardon of our national sins, and the restoration of our now divided and suffering Country, to its former happy condition of unity and peace.</p>
<p>In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>
<p>[L. S.]</p>
<p>Done at the City of Washington, this thirtieth day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States the eighty seventh.</p>

<p>Possibly there has been some misunderstanding in your case. You were nominated to, and rejected by the Senate. I have thought<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;159</span>
it a good rule, and have tried to act upon it, not to renominate any one whom the Senate has already rejected, unless I have evidence that the Senate would do differently on a second trial. In your case I now distinctly say that if any Senator, continuing in the Senate, will say in writing, that he voted against you, and that he has since investigated the case, and would now vote for you, and that he believes you would now be confirmed, I will renominate you. Without this, or something as strong, I can not do it. Yours truly A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>My opinion is, that just now, with the enemy directly ahead of us, there is <span class="rend-i">no</span> eligible route for us into Richmond; and consequently a question of preference between the Rappahannock route, and the James River route is a contest about nothing. Hence our prime object is the enemies' army in front of us, and is not with, or about, Richmond---at all, unless it be incidental to the main object.</p>
<p>What then? The two armies are face to face with a narrow river between them. Our communications are shorter and safer than are those of the enemy. For this reason, we can, with equal powers fret him more than he can us. I do not think that by raids towards Washington he can derange the Army of the Potomac at all. He has no distant opperations which can call any of the Army of the Potomac away; we have such operations which may call him<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;165</span>
away, at least in part. While he remains in tact, I do not think we should take the disadvantage of attacking him in his entrenchments; but we should continually harrass and menace him, so that he shall have no leisure, nor safety in sending away detachments.

<p>Richmond Whig of the 8th has no telegraphic despatches from Charleston but has the following as editorial.</p>
<p>``All thoughts are now centred upon Charleston. Official intelligence was made public early yesterday morning that the enemies iron clad fleet had attempted to cross the bar &amp; failed but later in the day it was announced that the gun boats &amp; transports had succeeded in crossing and were at anchor---our iron clads lay between the forts quietly awaiting the attacks. Further intelligence is looked for with eager anxiety. The Yankees have made no secret of their vast preparation for an attack on Charleston &amp; we may well anticipate a desperate conflict. At last the hour of trial has come for Charleston. The hour of deliverance or destruction for no one believes the other alternative, surrender, possible. The heart of the whole country yearns towards the beleagured city with intense solications [solicitude?] yet with hopes amounting to confidence. Charleston knows what is expected of her and what is due to her fame and to the relation she sustains to the cause.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;167</span>The devoted, the heroic, the great hearted Beauregard is there &amp; he too knows what is expected of him &amp; will not disappoint that expectation. We perdict a Sarragossa defense and that if Charleston is taken it will be only a heap of ruin.''</p>
<p>The rebel pickets are reported as calling over to our pickets today that we had taken some rebel fort. This is not very intelligible and I think is entirely unreliable. A LINCOLN</p>

<p>``Certainly the <span class="rend-i">Honor</span>, attached to the office ought to satisfy the ambition of the most aspiring, and the salary (which would but little if any more than defray the expenses of myself and family to &amp; from the place of duty,) is as much as a reasonable man should desire.

<p>``You remember that I received the command of the 11th Corps by your order under the Grand Division arrangement. When the latter was abolished, Gen. Sigel resumed command of the Corps. Soon afterwards he left it on leave of absence and . . . I assumed the command. But Gen. Hooker assigned Maj. Gen. Howard to the command of the Corps, which reduced me to my old Division. . . . I do not want to interfere with the arrangements already made but should be happy to be assigned to another Department, but I cannot go without my old troops. . . . I should be glad to be ordered off to Gen. Burnside or Gen. Rosecrans, and I am sure every man in my command would hail the order with enthusiasm. We have always been outsiders in this Army . . . and I have no doubt this Army will see us leave without regret, provided our place be filled by an equal number of American troops. . . . Gen. Howard agrees with me . . . and Gen. Hooker . . . will have no objection, if the gap left by my Division, which is one of the smallest anyhow, can be filled with other troops. . . . If you send me West with my boys, which I sincerely hope you will, I will take my chance without asking for anything more, except a good opportunity to fight.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>That Schurz did not speak for all his men is indicated by a letter from Brigadier General Adolph von Steinwehr to Major General Oliver O. Howard, April 5, ``I am informed, that General Schurz endeavors to obtain the command of the German troops of this corps &amp; to be ordered with them to Kentucky or elsewhere. . . .

<p>``After giving the subject my best reflection, I have concluded that I will have more chance of inflicting a serious blow upon the Enemy by turning his position to my right, and if practicable to sever his communication with Richmond with my Dragoon force, and such Batteries as it may be deemed advisable to send with them. I am apprehensive that he will retire from before me the moment I should succeed in crossing the river, and over the shortest line to Richmond, and thus escape being seriously crippled.</p>
<p>``I hope that when the Cavalry have established themselves on the line between him and Richmond, they will be able to hold him and check his retreat until I can fall on his rear---or if not that, I will compel him to fall back by the way of Culpepper, and Gordonsville over a longer line than my own with his supplies cut off.</p>
<p>``The Cavalry will probably cross the river above the Rappahannock bridge, thence to Culpepper and Gordonsville, and across to the Aquia Railroad somewhere in the vicinity of Hanover Court House. They will probably have a fight in the vicinity of Culpepper, but not one that should cause them much delay or embarrassment.</p>
<p>``I have given directions for the Cavalry to be in readiness to commence the movement on Monday morning next. While the Cavalry are moving, I shall threaten the passage of the river at various points, and after they have passed well to the Enemies rear, shall endeavor to effect the crossing.</p>
<p>``I hope Mr. President, that this plan will receive your approval. It will obviate the necessity of detaching a force from Washington in the direction of Warrenton, while I think it will enhance my chances for inflicting a heavy blow upon the enemies forces.</p>
<p>``We have no news from over the river today, the enemy refusing to let us have the newspaper.</p>

<p>My dear Sir: I did not certainly know the object of your call yesterday, but I had a strong impression in regard to it. When our national troubles began you and I were not personally acquainted; but all I heard of you placed you, in my estimation, foremost among Louisianians, as a friend of the Union.

When, last autumn, you bore a letter from me to some parties at New-Orleans, you seemed to expect, and consequently I did expect, you would return here as a member of one or the other branch of Congress. But you were not so returned; and this negative evidence, with other of like character, brings me to think that the Union people there, for some reason, prefer others for the places there [here?]. Add to this that the Head of the Department here, in which finding a place for you was contemplated, is not satisfied for the appointment to be made, and it presents, as you see an embarrassing case for me.

No censure upon you, or either of you, is intended. We still hope that by cordial and judicious co-operation, you can take the batteries on Morris Island and Sullivan's Island, and Fort-Sumpter. But whether you can or not we wish the demonstration kept up for a time, for a colatteral and very important object. We wish the attempt<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;174</span>
to be a real one, (though not a desperate one) if it affords any considerable chance of success. But if prossecuted as a <span class="rend-i">demonstration</span> only, this must not become public, or the whole effect will be lost. Once again before Charleston, do not leave till further orders from here. Of course this is not intended to force you to leave unduly exposed, Hilton Head, or other near points in your charge. Yours truly A. LINCOLN</p>
<p>P.S. Whoever receives this first, please send a copy to the other immediately. A. L.</p>

The ``apparent inconsistency'' to which Lincoln refers indicated by Welles' communication to Du Pont on April 2, ``The exigencies of the public service are so pressing in the Gulf that the Department directs you to send all the ironclads that are in a fit condition to move, after your present attack upon Charleston, directly to New Orleans, reserving to yourself only two.'' (OR, I, XIV, 436).</p>
<p>John Hay delivered Welles' order of April 2, and on April 16 he wrote Nicolay from Hilton Head, South Carolina, of the reception of Lincoln's order of April 13, as follows:</p>
<p>``The General and the Admiral this morning received the orders from Washington, directing the continuance of operations against Charleston. The contrast was very great in the manner in which they received them. The General was absolutely delighted. . . . He said, however, that the Admiral seemed in very low spirits about it. . . . Whether the intention of the Government be to reduce Charleston now . . . or by powerful demonstration to retain a large force of the enemy here, he is equally anxious to go to work again. . . .'' (Tyler Dennett, ed., <span class="rend-i">Lincoln and the Civil War in the Diaries and Letters of John Hay</span>, pp. 60-61).</p>
<p>Du Pont wrote Welles on April 16 as follows:</p>
<p>``I am . . . painfully struck by the tenor and tone of the President's order, which seems to imply a censure, and I have to request that the Department will not hesitate to relieve me by an officer who . . . is more able to execute that service in which I have had the misfortune to fail---the capture of Charleston. . . .''

<p>It is now 10-15.P.M. An hour ago I received your letter of this morning, and a few minutes later your despatch of this evening. The latter gives me considerable uneasiness. The rain and mud, of course, were to be calculated upon. Gen. S. is not moving rapidly enough to make the expedition come to any thing. He has now been out three days, two of which were unusually fine weather, and all three without hindrance from the enemy, and yet he is not twentyfive miles from where he started. To reach his point, he still has sixty to go; another river, the Rapidan, to cross, and will be hindered by the enemy. By arithmetic, how many days will it take him to do it? I do not know that any better can be done, but I greatly fear it is another failure already. Write me often. I am very anxious. Yours truly A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS-F, ISLA. Hooker's letter of April 15 is as follows:</p>
<p>``A letter from Maj Genl. Stoneman dated 1 o'clock P.M. yesterday, informs me that his command will be across the river before daylight this morning the 15th. It was his intention to cross at three points, all above the Rappahannock Station. I sent him six days rations, for men and animals, by wagons to be distributed just before his passage of the river. The wagons are now on their return. From the Rappahannock, if he should meet with no unusual delay, he will strike the Aquia and Richmond Rail Road on the night of the second day. Meanwhile I shall do what I can to keep the Enemy up to their works in my front and if they should fall back shall pursue with all the vigor practicable.</p>
<p>``Up to late last night the Enemy appeared to have no suspicion of our designs. This morning I can see nothing, from the storm.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;176</span>``I am rejoiced that Stoneman had two good days to go up the river and was enabled to cross it before it had become too much swollen.</p>
<p>``If he can reach his position the storm and mud will not damage our prospects.</p>
<p>``He has been furnished with a copy of Maj. Genl Peck's despatch regarding the Enemy in his immediate front. If it should be true Richmond can have no soldiers in the city at this time.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>Hooker's telegram of 8 P.M. the same day is as follows:</p>
<p>``Just heard from Genl. S[toneman]. His Artillery has been brought to a halt by the mud One Division only having crossed the river. If practicable, he will proceed without it. All the streams are swimming.'' <span class="rend-i">(Ibid.)</span>.</p>
<p>On April 17 Hooker replied to Lincoln's letter of the 15th:</p>
<p>``I have the honor to acknowledge your communication of the night of the 15th inst. and in compliance with your request, transmit herewith a letter from Genl. Stoneman dated the 16th inst, as it will fully inform you of the circumstances attending his march up the river. . . . The letter was this moment received.</p>
<p>``His failure, to accomplish speedily the objects of his expedition, is a source of deep regret . . . but I can find nothing in his conduct . . . requiring . . . censure. We cannot control the elements.</p>
<p>``From your letter I conclude that you had misapprehended the position of his advance the night of the second day out . . . which was on the South Side of the Rappahannock and fifty miles from this camp. . . .</p>
<p>``I have given directions for him to remain in his present position, holding himself in readiness to march as soon, after, the roads and rivers will permit. . . . I still hope to turn his movement to some good account. . . .</p>
<p>``No one, Mr President can be more anxious, than myself to relieve your cares and anxieties and you may be assured that I shall spare no labor, and suffer no opportunity to pass unimproved, for so doing.</p>
<p>``We have no reason to suppose that the enemy have any knowledge of the design of Genl. Stoneman's movement.'' <span class="rend-i">(Ibid.)</span>.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; AD-F, ISLA. The resolutions are written on the back of a page of Executive Mansion stationery. On the front page appears the following notation by John Bright:</p>
<p>``Extract from a letter from the Honble. Chas. Sumner, dated Washington April 17th. 1863.</p>
<p>`` `Two days ago the President sent for me to come to him at once. When I<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;177</span>
arrived, he said that he had been thinking of a matter on which we had often spoken, the way in which English opinion should be directed, &amp; that he had drawn up a resolution embodying the ideas which he should hope to see adopted by public meetings in England. I inclose the resolution, in his autograph, as he gave it to me. He thought it might serve to suggest the point which he regarded as important.' ''</p>
<p>No record has been found of the adoption of these resolutions in England. On November 30, 1863, Sumner wrote Lincoln concerning articles in the London <span class="rend-i">Post</span> which threatened ```recognition' of the rebel slave-mongers, in the event of any reverse to the national arms.'' Sumner suggested that ``in yr message you should refer to the resolutions of Congress [reported by Sumner on February 28, 1863, expressing regret that foreign powers had not informed the confederate States that they could not expect recognition], and mention that they have been sent to Foreign Courts;---and then add to this statement the enunciation of the principle you so well expressed in the memdm. you gave to me last spring---to the effect, that, while in times past there have been nations where slavery was an incident, now, for the first time in human history a new Power presents itself &amp; asks `recognition' in the Christian Family, whose only declared reason of separate existence is the support of slavery --- &amp; that no such power can expect any such `recognition,' but that Christian states are bound to set their faces against it.'' (Copy, DLC-Nicolay Papers). Lincoln did not follow Sumner's suggestion by incorporating the reference in his Annual Message to Congress of December 8, 1863.</p>

I told you that the non-exemption of it from the former, was a mere omission, which would be corrected; and that it should also be exempted from the final emancipation Proclamation. The preliminary</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;187</span>Emancipation Proclamation does not define what is included, or excluded; but only gives notice that this will be done in the final one. Both yourself and Gen. Dix, at different times, (Gen.

Without being reminded by either him or yourself, I do not think I should have omitted to exempt it from the final Emancipation Proclamation; but at all events, you did not allow me to forget it.

Leavenworth, Kansas--- Washington, April 27. 1863.</div>
<p>The Governor of Kansas is here, asking that Lieut. Col. J. M. Williams, of a colored regiment there, shall be removed; and also complaining of the military interference of Gen. Blunt in the late election at Leavenworth. I do not know how, if at all, you are connected with these things; but I wish your assistance to so shape things that the Governor of Kansas may be treated with the consideration that is extended to Governors of other States. We are not forcing a Regimental officer upon any other governor, against his protest. Can not this matter be somehow adjusted? A. LINCOLN.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS, CSmH. Hooker's letter of April 27 is as follows:</p>
<p>``I fully appreciate the anxiety weighing upon your mind, and hasten to relieve you from so much of it as lies in my power. You know that nothing would give me more pleasure than to keep you fully advised of every movement and every intended movement made and to be made by this Army, as is my duty to do. But the country is so full of traitors, and there are so many whose desire it is to see this Army meet with no success, that it almost makes me tremble to disclose a thing concerning it to anyone except yourself. Not that there are not many as true to the cause as yourself; but all have friends and their fidelity I am not so sure of. The following is what I have done and what I propose to do. The 11th 12th &amp; 5th Corps marched this morning, with instructions to take posts at Kelley's Ford at 4 P.M. tomorrow. The Ford being still deep for Artillery, a Ponton train will be in readiness to be thrown across the river, in season I hope, for one or two Corps to cross before morning and take the route to cross the Rapidan at Germania hills and the other Corps to cross at Ely's Ford about the same time and both to march on Chancellorsville and meet there the second night from Kelly's Ford. The Corps march light, with their pack trains of small ammunition, leaving their wagon trains to be crossed on a more direct line when they become opened.</p>
<p>``Simultaneous with this the 6th, 1st &amp; 3rd Corps will cross in the vicinity of Franklin's crossing and make honest demonstrations on the Telegraph and Bowling Green roads, where the main Rebel bodies behind their defences are posted. Keeping them in their places, and if they should detach heavy forces to attack the troops coming down the river, to storm and carry those works and take possession of the enemy's short line of retreat. At the same time, Stoneman will cross with his cavalry to carry out the instructions, a copy of which has already been furnished you. This is an outline, you will be able to fill up the plan. The object in crossing high up the river is to come down in rear of the enemy holding strong positions at the U.S. and Banks Fords, and so strongly fortified that they can only be carried with great loss of life if at all, from a front attack. They are held, as you will see by the accompanying map, by a small force, but the crossings are rendered formidable by the character of the defences.</p>
<p>``The only element which gives me apprehension with regard to the success of this plan is the weather. How much will depend upon it. The details will readily suggest themselves to you.</p>
<p>``After crossing the Rapidan I can hear from the column descending the rivers, by the troops now at Bank's Ford, where I shall throw over two bridges as soon as the development of the battle will permit.</p>
<p>``I write in great haste as I leave for Kelley's Ford tomorrow morning and am busy in making the necessary preparations.</p>
<p>``I send you the Richmond papers last received. The remarkable feature in them is that they write from Fredericksburg that in their opinion we are quitting this line.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>

On this state of case I wrote a special indorsement on the order, which I suppose he will present to you; and I write this merely to assure you that no censure is intended upon you; but that it is hoped that you will inquire into the case more minutely, and that if there be no evidence, but his refusal to sanction the resolution, you will restore him.

How this is I must understand better than I now do, before I can approve his dismissal. What has he done? What has he said?

<p>The recent movement of your army is ended without effecting it's object, except perhaps some important breakings of the enemies communications. What next? If possible I would be very glad of another movement early enough to give us some benefit from the fact of the enemies communications being broken, but neither for this reason or any other, do I wish anything done in desperation or rashness. An early movement would also help to supersede the bad moral effect of the recent one, which is sure to be considerably injurious. Have you already in your mind a plan wholly, or partially formed? If you have, prossecute it without interference from me. If you have not, please inform me, so that I, incompetent as I may be, can try [to] assist in the formation of some plan for the Army. Yours as ever A LINCOLN</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS-F, ISLA. Copies of this letter and of Hooker's reply are preserved in the Lincoln Papers in an envelope endorsed by Lincoln ``Gen. Hooker. Visit to camp, May 7 1863.'' Hooker's reply is as follows:</p>
<p>``I have the honor to acknowledge your communication of this date, and in answer have to state that I do not deem it expedient to suspend operations on this line from the reverse we have experienced in endeavoring to extricate the army from its present position. If in the first effort we failed it was not from want of strength or conduct of the small number of the troops actually engaged, but from a cause which could not be foreseen, and could not be provided against. After its occurrence the chances of success were so much lessened that I felt another plan might be adopted in place of that we were engaged in, which would be more certain in its results. At all events, a failure would not involve disaster, while in the other case it was certain to follow the absence of success. I may add that this consideration almost wholly determined me in ordering the army to return to its old camp.</p>
<p>``As to the best time for renewing our advance upon the enemy, I can only decide after an opportunity has been afforded to learn the feeling of the troops. They should not be discouraged or depressed, for it is no fault of theirs---if I may except one Corps---that our last efforts were not crowned with glorious victory. I suppose details are not wanted of me at this time.</p>
<p>``I have decided in my own mind the plan to be adopted in our next effort, ---if it should be your wish to have one made. It has this to recommend it---It will be one in which the operations of all the Corps, unless it be a part of the Cavalry, will be within my personal supervision.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>

<p>Whereas the Congress of the United States, at its last Session, enacted a law, entitled ``An Act for enrolling and calling out the National Forces and for other purposes,'' which was approved on the 3d. day of March, last: and whereas it is recited in the said act that there now exist in the United States an insurrection and rebellion against the authority thereof, and it is, under the constitution of the United States, the duty of the Government to suppress insurrection and rebellion, to guaranty to each state a republican form of Government, and to preserve the public tranquillity; and whereas, for these high purposes, a military force is indispensable, to raise and support which all persons ought willingly to contribute; and whereas no service can be more praiseworthy and honorable than that which is rendered for the maintenance of the Constitution and Union, and the consequent preservation of free government: and whereas, for the reasons thus recited, it was enacted by the said statute that all able bodied male citizens of the United States, and persons of foreign birth who shall have declared on oath their intention to become citizens under and in pursuance of the laws thereof, between the ages of<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;204</span>
twenty and forty-five years, (with certain exceptions not necessary to be here mentioned,) are declared to constitute the national forces, and shall be liable to perform military duty in the service of the United States when called out by the President for that purpose:</p>
<p>And whereas it is claimed by and in behalf of persons of foreign birth, within the ages specified in said act, who have heretofore declared on oath their intentions to become citizens under, and in pursuance of, the laws of the United States, and who have not exercised the right of suffrage or any other political franchise under the laws of the United States, or of any of the States thereof, that they are not absolutely concluded by their aforesaid declaration of intention from renouncing their purpose to become citizens, and that, on the contrary, such persons, under treaties or the law of nations, retain a right to renounce that purpose, and to forego the privileges of citizenship and residence within the United States, under the obligations imposed by the aforesaid Act of Congress:---</p>
<p>Now, therefore, to avoid all misapprehensions concerning the liability of persons concerned to perform the service required by such enactment, and to give it full effect, I do hereby order and proclaim that no plea of alienage will be received or allowed to exempt from the obligations imposed by the aforesaid Act of Congress, any person of foreign birth who shall have declared on oath his intention to become a citizen of the United States under the laws thereof, and who shall be found within the United States at any time during the continuance of the present insurrection and rebellion, at or after the expiration of the period of sixty-five days from the date of this proclamation; nor shall any such plea of alienage be allowed in favor of any such person who has so, as aforesaid, declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States, and shall have exercised, at any time, the right of suffrage, or any other political franchise, within the United States under the laws thereof, or under the laws of any of the several States.</p>

<p>To C. W. Rand, Esq., Marshal of the United States for the Northern District of California:</p>
<p>Whereas, it has come to my knowledge that one Andres Castillero, and divers persons acting or claiming to act under him as his agents or assigns, have, under and by virtue of a pretended grant or grants from the lawfully constituted authorities of the Republic of Mexico, occupied and taken possession of, and made settlement on a portion of the public lands of the United States situate in the Country of Santa Clara and State of California, commonly called and known as the New Almaden Quicksilver mining property, and embracing about three thousand varas of land in all directions from the mouth of the mine commonly called and known as the New Almaden Quicksilver Mine, and have, for a long time past, by extracting valuable minerals therefrom and converting the same to their own use; by erecting buildings and other improvements thereon, and by other unauthorized acts, used and enjoyed the said portion of the public lands as if they were the lawful owners thereof, all of which acts have been without the consent, and against the rights of the United States: And whereas, by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Andres Castillero against the United States, at the December Term of the said Court last past, it has been adjudged that the grant or grants from the lawfully constituted authorities of the Republic of Mexico, under which the said Andres Castillero and the persons claiming under him as agents or assigns, have claimed and pretended to hold the said described portion of the public lands, is or are fraudulent and void, and conferred no right whatever to the said described portion of the public lands or to the minerals therein, whereby it appears that the said Andres Castillero and the persons claiming under him as agents or assigns, now in possession of the said described premises, are intruders thereon without right: And whereas, the said described portion of the public lands has never been surveyed and opened to settlement and sale under the laws of the United States:</p>

<p>``With regard to the treatment of the poor, defenceless blacks . . . I can only say that W. Lilly's course was such as to outrage all the common feelings of humanity, characterised by the most cowardly and brutal treatment, and apparently in one or two instances by criminal indecency. Habitually in a state of partial intoxication, he grossly insulted the wife of the only loyal white man in South Carolina who claimed our protection, while her husband and herself were in his house.</p>
<p>``Unanimously rejected by the Senate as an Assistant Quartermaster, a Court Martial held on the spot where he performed his `efficient service,' after a long and impartial trial, justly sentenced him to be cashiered.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>On May 15, Senator Henry Wilson wrote Lincoln, ``I am constrained by a sense of duty, after reading papers in the War office, to withdraw my letter in favor of Mr Lilley for Quarter Master. I had not examined the matter, and relied . . . upon the opinion of Mr. King, but I find I have made a mistake, and desire to right it.'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>.).</p>

<p>``Some weeks ago you verbally directed me to investigate the papers connected with the case of the Collector for the Puget Sound District. . . .</p>
<p>``Almost immediately afterwards important business . . . called me to the Eastern Cities. On leaving I directed the Assistant Secretary to examine all the papers . . . so that, on my return, I could at once make the investigation you required.</p>
<p>``I came back on Friday night (8th) &amp; was informed . . . that you had already directed him to make out . . . a Commission for a new Collector.</p>
<p>``This information surprised and greatly pained me; for I had not thought it possible that you would remove an officer of My Department, without awaiting the result, although somewhat delayed, of an investigation directed by yourself; and appoint a successor . . . without even consulting me. . . .</p>
<p>``Today I have received your note stating that the person for whom, in my<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;210</span>
absence, a commission was prepared, is deceased; and directing one to be made out for another person of whom I know absolutely nothing. . . .</p>
<p>``I can ask, of course, nothing more than conference. The right of appointment belongs to you; and if . . . your judgment . . . differs from mine, it is my duty to acquiesce, cheerfully; unless, indeed, the case be one of such a character, as to justify my withdrawal from my post. I have, however, a right to be consulted. . . .</p>
<p>``The blank commission which you direct me to send . . . is enclosed. . . . It is enclosed, however, with my most respectful protest against the precedent; and with the assurance that if you find anything in my views to which your own sense of duty will not permit you to assent, I will, unhesitatingly, relieve you from all embarrassment so far as I am concerned by tendering you my resignation.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>Lincoln endorsed on the envelope, ``First offer of resignation.'' Lewis C. Gunn of California was appointed to replace Victor Smith, but in 1865 Frederick A. Wilson received the post following Gunn's resignation. See Lincoln to Chase, May 13, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>.</p>

On May 8, Burnside telegraphed in reply to a non-extant telegram from Lincoln, ``Your dispatch just rec'd. I thank you for your kind assurance of support &amp; beg to say that every possible effort will be made on my part to sustain the Govt of the United States in its fullest authority.'' (DLC-RTL). The furor in Ohio and throughout the North over the arrest and ensuing trial was such that Secretary Stanton feared the impact on Union morale if the U.S. district judge should ignore the general proclamation suspending the writ of habeas corpus. On May 13, he therefore prepared an order especially suspending the writ in Vallandigham's case and drafted an accompanying despatch to Burnside. Both documents, unsigned, are<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;216</span></p>

<p>My dear Sir: When I wrote you on the 7th. I had an impression that possibly, by an early movement, you could get some advantage from the supposed facts that the enemies communications were disturbed and that he was somewhat deranged in position. That idea has now passed away, the enemy having re-established his communications, regained his positions and actually received re-inforcements. It does not now appear probable to me that you can gain any thing by an early renewal of the attempt to cross the Rappahannock. I therefore shall not complain, if you do no more, for a time, than to keep the enemy at bay, and out of other mischief, by menaces and occasional cavalry raids, if practicable; and to put your own army in good condition again. Still, if in your own clear judgment, you can renew the attack successfully, I do not mean to restrain you. Bearing upon this last point, I must tell you I have some painful intimations that some of your corps and Division Commanders are not giving you their entire confidence. This would be ruinous, if true; and you should therefore, first of all, ascertain the real facts beyond all possibility of doubt. Yours truly A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>``My movements have been a little delayed by the withdrawal of many of the two-years' and nine-months' regiments, and those whose time is not already up it will be expedient to leave on this side of the river. This reduction imposes upon me the necessity of partial reorganization. My marching force of infantry is cut down to about 80,000, while I have artillery for an army of more than double that number. It has always been out of proportion, considering the character of the country we have to campaign in, and I shall be more efficient by leaving at least one-half of it in depot. In addition, Stoneman's cavalry returned<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;218</span>
to camp day before yesterday, and will require a day or two more to be in readiness to resume operations.</p>
<p>``I know that you are impatient, and I know that I am, but my impatience must not be indulged at the expense of dearest interests.</p>
<p>``I am informed that the bulk of Longstreet's force is in Richmond. With the facilities at hand, he can readily transfer it to Lee's army, and no doubt will do so if Lee should fight and fall back, as he will try to do.</p>
<p>``The enemy's camps are reported to me as being more numerous than before our last movement, but of this I have no positive information. They probably have about the same number of troops as before the last battle, but with these and Longstreet's they are much my superior, besides having the advantage of acting on the defensive, which, in this country, can scarcely be estimated.</p>
<p>``I hear nothing of Peck's movements and of the force at West Point, which is too small to be of much importance in the general movement. If it is expected that Peck will be able to keep Longstreet's force in and about Richmond, I should be informed of it, and if not, a reserve infantry force of 25,000 should be placed at my disposal in this vicinity. I merely state this for your information, not that I know even that you have such a force, or, if you have, that you would be disposed to make use of it in this way. I only desire that you should be informed of my views. In my opinion, the major part of the troops on the Upper Potomac, in and around Washington and Baltimore, are out of position, and if great results are expected from the approaching movement, every man and vessel at the disposal of the Government should be assigned their posts. I hope to be able to commence my movement to-morrow, but this must not be spoken of to any one. . . .'' (OR, I, XXV, II, 473).</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ES-F, ISLA. Lincoln's endorsement is written on a letter from George D. Prentice, May 6, 1863, requesting that the president reply to an earlier letter of April 28 which reads:<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;220</span></p>
<p>``Mr. Lincoln, I have a great favor to ask of you. Hear me! My only child, Clarence J. Prentice, God help him, is a major in the Confederate service. A few weeks ago he came into Kentucky and being cut off from his command he came by night to his home to see me and his mother and his baby. He was seen coming and in a few hours arrested. He is now at Camp Chase and his mother in Columbus. He desires I know to serve no longer in the war. He would be a great loss to the Confederates, for he has been one of their most effective officers.</p>
<p>``I do not suppose . . . that you can parole my boy upon his taking the noncombatant's oath to remain in the United States though I should be most happy if you could; but I fervently appeal to you to let him go upon his taking that simple oath anywhere outside of the United States and of the rebel Confederacy. I know his plans. His mother will go with him and he will never bear arms against us again. I will be surety for this with fortune and life. I have written to General Burnside to let my son remain at Camp Chase till I hear from you. Please let it be soon for I am most unhappy.'' (OR, II, V, 527-28).</p>
<p>As printed in the <span class="rend-i">Official Records</span>, Prentice's letter of April 28 bears three endorsements. The first, Joseph Holt to Stanton, May 16, 1863, is as follows: ``Clarence J. Prentice himself has made no communication to the Government purposes. When prisoners of war are willing to take the oath of allegiance it is the practice to permit them to do so. When they are not thus willing they have been invariably exchanged under the cartel. The intermediate course now proposed has not been pursued because the Government would thereby lose the advantage of the exchange and because no satisfactory . . . guaranty would exist that the prisoner thus tenderly dealt with would not at the first opportunity reenter the rebel military service. . . . He left his home in a State then and still loyal and voluntarily and wantonly banded with traitors. . . . It is for the Secretary to determine whether the established policy . . . shall be modified in his favor.''</p>
<p>The second endorsement, Brigadier General Edward R. S. Canby to Colonel William Hoffman, commissary general of prisoners, is dated May 22: ``Colonel: I submitted this paper to the Secretary of War yesterday and he said that he was under the impression that the President had given an order permitting Prentice to go abroad. Has it been done?''</p>
<p>The third endorsement, Hoffman to Canby, undated, is as follows: ``There is no record in this office of any special orders in the case of Major Prentice. On the 13th instant he was sent from Camp Chase to City Point for exchange.''</p>
<p>One infers that Prentice's letter of May 6, bearing Lincoln's order of May 16 endorsed on the verso, was ``lost'' in the War Department. Major Clarence Prentice was exchanged and fought on until the end of the war as major and later colonel in the Confederate Army.</p>

The telegram of Sunday, May 17, is as follows: ``Samuel B. Churchill, of Saint Louis, was arrested in this city by order of General Curtis and taken to Saint Louis. We understand that he with his family . . . are ordered to leave for the South on Wednesday. We know Churchill well, being an old schoolmate and intimate friend to both of us. His father. . . . died a few months ago leaving a large estate and the prisoner one of his executors, with important and indispensable duties to discharge in which many of our and your friends are deeply interested, none of which can be discharged without his discretion. In view of all the circumstances we ask a revocation of this order, and we will hold ourselves bound for the faithful performance of any obligation which may be imposed on him. . . .

<p>In order to construct the Illinois Central Railroad, a large grant of land was made by the United States to the State of Illinois, which land was again given to the Railroad Company by the State, in certain provisions of the Charter. By the U.S. grant, certain previleges were attempted to be secured from the contemplated Railroad to the U.S., and by the charter certain per centage of the income of the road was to be from time to time paid to the State of Illinois. At the beginning of the present war the Railroad did certain carrying for the U.S. for which it claims pay; and, as I understand, the U.S. claims that at least part of this the road was bound to do without pay. Though attempts have been made to settle the matter, it remains unsettled; meanwhile the Road refuses to pay the per-centage to the State. This delay is working badly; and I understand the delay exists because of there being no definite decision whether the U.S. will settle it's own account with the Railroad, or will allow the State to settle it, &amp; account to the State for it. If I had the leisure which I have not, I believe I could settle<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;228</span>
it; but <span class="rend-i">prima facie</span> it appears to me we better settle the account ourselves, because that will save us all question as to whether the State deals fairly with us in the settlement of our account with a third party---the R.R.</p>

Hon. I. N. Arnold. Executive Mansion,<br>
My dear Sir: Washington, May 26. 1863.</div>
<p>Your letter advising me to dismiss Gen. Halleck is received. If the public believe, as you say, that he has driven Fremont, Butler, and Sigel from the service, they believe what I know to be false; so that if I were to yield to it, it would only be to be instantly beset by some other demand based on another falsehood equally gross. You know yourself that Fremont was relieved at his own request, before Halleck could have had any thing to do with it--- went out near the end of June, while Halleck only came in near the end of July. I know equally well that no wish of Halleck's had any thing to do with the removal of Butler or Sigel. Sigel, like Fremont, was relieved at his own request, pressed upon me almost constantly for six months, and upon complaints that could have been made as justly by almost any corps commander in the army, and more justly by some. So much for the way they got out. Now a word as to their not getting back. In the early Spring, Gen. Fremont sought active service again; and, as it seemed to me, sought it in a very good, and reasonable spirit. But he holds the highest rank in the Army, except McClellan, so that I could not well offer him a subordinate command. Was I to displace Hooker, or Hunter, or Rosecrans, or Grant, or Banks? If not, what was I to do? And similar to this, is the case of both the others. One month after Gen. Butler's return, I offered him a position in which I thought and still think, he could have done himself the highest credit, and the country the greatest service, but he declined it.<span class="ptr"><a name="6_230_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_230_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> When Gen. Sigel was relieved, at his own request as I have said, of course I had to put another in command of his corps. Can I instantly thrust that other out to put him in again?</p>
<p>And now my good friend, let me turn your eyes upon another point. Whether Gen. Grant shall or shall not consummate the capture of Vicksburg, his campaign from the beginning of this month up to the twenty second day of it, is one of the most brilliant in the world. His corps commanders, &amp; Division commanders, in part, are McClernand, McPherson,<span class="ptr"><a name="6_230_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_230_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> Sherman, Steele, Hovey,<span class="ptr"><a name="6_230_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_230_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[4]</a></span> Blair, &amp; Logan. And yet taking Gen. Grant &amp; these seven of his generals, and you can scarcely name one of them that has not been constantly denounced and opposed by the same men who are now so anxious to get Halleck out, and Fremont &amp; Butler &amp; Sigel in. I believe no one of them went through the Senate easily, and certainly<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;231</span>
one failed to get through at all.<span class="ptr"><a name="6_231_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_231_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[5]</a></span> I am compelled to take a more impartial and unprejudiced view of things. Without claiming to be your superior, which I do not, my position enables me to understand my duty in all these matters better than you possibly can, and I hope you do not yet doubt my integrity. Your friend, as ever A. LINCOLN</p>

Gen. J. M. Schofield Washington, May 27. 1863.</div>
<p>My dear Sir: Having relieved Gen. Curtis and assigned you to the command of the Department of the Missouri---I think it may be of some advantage for me to state to you why I did it. I did not relieve Gen. Curtis because of any full conviction that he had done wrong by commission or omission. I did it because of a conviction in my mind that the Union men of Missouri, constituting, when united, a vast majority of the whole people, have entered into a pestilent factional quarrel among themselves, Gen. Curtis, perhaps not of choice, being the head of one faction, and Gov. Gamble that of the other. After months of labor to reconcile the difficulty, it seemed to grow worse and worse until I felt it my duty to break it up some how; and as I could not remove Gov. Gamble, I had to remove Gen. Curtis. Now that you are in the position, I wish you to undo nothing merely because Gen. Curtis or Gov. Gamble did it; but to exercise your own judgment, and do <span class="rend-i">right</span> for the public interest. Let your military measures be strong enough to repel the invader and keep the peace, and not so strong as to unnecessarily harrass and persecute the people. It is a difficult <span class="rend-i">role</span>, and so much greater will be the honor if you perform it well. If both factions, or neither, shall abuse you, you will probably be about right.

My dear Sir Washington, May 28. 1863.</div>
<p>I have but a slight personal acquaintance with Col. Jaquess, though I know him very well by character. Such a mission as he proposes I think promises good, if it were free from difficulties, which I fear it can not be. First, he can not go with any government authority whatever. This is absolute and imperative. Secondly, if he goes without authority, he takes a great deal of personal risk---he may be condemned, and executed as a spy. If, for any reason, you think fit to give Col. Jaquess a Furlough, and any authority from me, for that object, is necessary, you hereby have it for any length of time you see fit. Yours very truly</p>

<div class="opener">Hon. Charles Sumner Executive Mansion,<br>
My dear Sir. Washington, June 1. 1863.</div>
<p>In relation to the matter spoken of Saturday morning, and this morning, towit, the raising of colored troops in the North, with<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;243</span>
the understanding that they shall be commanded by Gen. Fremont, I have to say</p>
<p>That while it is very objectionable, as a general rule, to have troops raised on any special terms, such as to serve only under a particular commander, or only at a particular place or places, yet I would forego the objection in this case, upon a fair prospect that a large force of this sort could thereby be the more rapidly raised</p>
<p>That being raised, say to the number of ten thousand, I would very cheerfully send them to the field under Gen. Fremont, assigning him a Department, made or to be made, with such white force also as I might be able to put in.</p>
<p>That with the best wishes towards Gen. Fremont, I can not now give him a Department, because I have not spare troops to furnish a new Department; and I have not, as I think, justifiable ground to relieve the present commander of any old one.</p>

<p>It has been my happiness to receive testimonies of a similar nature, from I believe, all denominations of Christians. They are all loyal, but perhaps not in the same degree, or in the same numbers; but I think they all claim to be loyal. This to me is most gratifying, because from the beginning I saw that the issues of our great struggle depended on the Divine interposition and favor. If we had that, all would be well. The proportions of this rebellion were not for a long time understood. I saw that it involved the greatest difficulties,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;245</span>
and would call forth all the powers of the whole country. The end is not yet.</p>
<p>The point made in your paper is well taken as to ``the Government'' and the ``administration'' in whose hands are those interests. I fully appreciate its correctness and justice. In my administration I might have committed some errors. It would be, indeed, remarkable if I had not. I have acted according to my best judgment in every case. The views expressed by the Committee accord with my own; and on this principle ``the Government'' is to be supported though the administration may not in every case wisely act. As a pilot, I have used my best exertions to keep afloat our ship of State, and shall be glad to resign my trust at the appointed time to another pilot more skillful and successful than I may prove. In every case, and at all hazards, the Government must be perpetuated. Relying, as I do, upon the Almighty Power, and encouraged as I am by these resolutions which you have just read, with the support which I receive from Christian men, I shall not hesitate to use all the means at my control to secure the termination of this rebellion, and will hope for success.</p>
<p>I sincerely thank you for this interview, this pleasant mode of presentation, and the General Assembly for their patriotic support in these resolutions.</p>

Thompson, June 2, 1863, proposing that immigrants and Negroes be organized into military units to work on the proposed Metropolitan Railroad of which Thompson was president and which was to be built from Washington to Pittsburgh. The proposal was that the government pay the troops for four months to work for the corporation eight hours, with two hours daily drill. Following this period the troops would be sent to regular duty, and the funds expended by the government would be repaid by the corporation when its railroad was in operation.</p>
<p>Halleck returned the papers on the same day with the following endorsement: ``It has been found impossible to procure sufficient labor of enlisted men or `contrabands' to complete the forts around Washington or at Harpers Ferry. I think that any emigrants or Negroes who are paid out of the public Treasury had better be employed on the forts rather than let out to work for corporations.

<p>Yours of to-day was received an hour ago. So much of professional military skill is requisite to answer it, that I have turned the task over to Gen. Halleck. He promises to perform it with his utmost care. I have but one idea which I think worth suggesting to you, and that is in case you find Lee coming to the North of the Rappahannock, I would by no means cross to the South of it. If he should leave a rear force at Fredericksburg, tempting you to fall upon it, it would fight in intrenchments, and have you at disadvantage, and so, man for man, worst you at that point, while his main force would in some way be getting an advantage of you Northward. In one word, I would not take any risk of being entangled upon the river, like an ox jumped half over a fence, and liable to be torn by dogs, front and rear, without a fair chance to gore one way or kick the other. If Lee would come to my side of the river, I would keep on the same side &amp; fight him, or act on the defence, according as might be my estimate of his strength relatively to my own. But these are mere suggestions which I desire to be controlled by the judgment of yourself and Gen. Halleck.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS, IHi. Hooker's telegram of June 5, is as follows:</p>
<p>``Yesterday morning appearances indicated that during the night the Enemy had broken up a few of his camps and abandoned them. These changes were observed on the right of his line in the vicinity of Hamilton Crossing. So far as I was enabled to judge from all my means of information it was impossible for me to determine satisfactorily whether this movement had been merely a change of camps---the Enemy had moved in the direction of Richmond, or up the river, but taken in connection with the fact that some deserters came in from the divisions of [John B.] Hood and [George] Pickett I conclude that those divisions had been brought to the front from their late positions at Gordonsville and Taylorville and that this could be for no other purpose but to enable the Enemy to move up the river with a view to the execution of a movement similar to that of Lee's last year. He must either have it in mind to<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;250</span>
cross the Upper Potomac or to throw his army between mine and Washington. In case I am correct in my conjecture, to accomplish either he must have been greatly reinforced and, if making this movement, the fair presumption is that he has been by the troops from Charleston</p>
<p>``Of this I have no evidence farther than that furnished me by Gen Dix that they had come to Richmond</p>
<p>``This morning some more of their camps have disappeared. Their picket line along the river is preserved and as strong as ever. Gen Buford with three divisions of Cavalry and ten pieces of Artillery is on the Alexandria and Orange Rail Road and yesterday was along the river beyond Sulphur Springs and reports no Enemy. As I am liable to be called on to make a movement with the utmost promptitude I desire that I may be informed as early as practicable of the views of the Government concerning this Army. Under instructions from the Maj Genl Com'd'g the army dated Jany 31st. I am instructed to keep in view always the importance of covering Washington and Harpers Ferry either directly or by so operating as to be able to punish any force of the Enemy sent against them.</p>
<p>``In the event the Enemy should move, as I almost anticipate he will the head of his column will probably be headed towards the Potomac via Gordonsville or Culpepper while the rear will rest on Fredericksburg. After giving the subject my best reflections I am of opinion that it is my duty to pitch into his rear although in so doing the head of his column may reach Warrenton before I can return. Will it be within the spirit of my instructions to do so? In view of these contemplated movements of the Enemy I cannot too forcibly impress upon the mind of His Excellency The President the necessity of having one commander for all of the troops whose operations can have influence on those of Lee's army. Under the present system all independent commanders are in ignorance of the movements of the others at least such is my situation.</p>
<p>``I trust that I may not be considered in the way to this arrangement as it is a position I do not desire and only suggest it as I feel the necessity for concerted as well as vigorous action. It is necessary for me to say this much that my motive may not be misunderstood. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>

In regard to the contingency which you suppose may arise of General Lee's leaving a part of his forces in Fredericksburg, while, with the head of his column, he moves by Gordonsville or Culpeper toward the Potomac, it seems to me that such an operation would give you great advantages upon his flank to cut him in two, and fight his divided forces. Would it not be more advantageous to fight his movable column first, instead of first attacking his intrenchments, with your own forces separated by the Rappahannock? Moreover, you are aware that the troops under General Heintzelman are much less than the number recommended . . . for the defenses of Washington. Neither this capital nor Harper's Ferry could long hold out against a large force. They must depend for their security very much upon the co-operation of your army. It would, therefore, seem perilous to permit Lee's main force to move upon the Potomac while your army is attacking an intrenched position on the other side of the Rappahannock. Of course your movements must depend in a great measure upon those made by Lee. There is another contingency not altogether improbable---that Lee will seek to hold you in check with his main force, while a strong force will be detached for a raid into Maryland and Pennsylvania. The main force of the enemy in North Carolina have probably come north, but I think all available troops in South Carolina and Georgia have been sent to re-enforce Johnston in Mississippi. Such is the information here. General Heintzelman<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;251</span>
and General Dix are instructed to telegraph directly to you all the movements which they may ascertain or make. Directions have also been given to forward military information which may be received from General Schenck's command. Any movements you may suggest of troops in these commands will be ordered, if deemed practicable. Lee will probably move light and rapidly. Your movable force should be prepared to do the same.</p>
<p>``The foregoing views are approved by the President.'' (OR, I, XXVII, I, 31-32).</p>

Editor of the Chronicle. Washington, June 6. 1863.</div>
<p>In your issue of this morning, you have an article on the ``Chicago Times.'' Being an Illinoisian, I happen to know that much of the article is incorrect. As I remember, upon the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, the democratic newspapers at Chicago went over to the opposition. Thereupon the Times was established by the friends of the administration, Senator Douglas being the most prominent in establishing it. A man by the name of James Sheahan, from this city, was it's first, and only editor, nearly if not quite all the remainder of the Senator's life. On the political separation between Mr. Buchanan and Senator Douglas, the Times adhered to the Senator, and was the ablest paper in his support through his senatorial contest with Mr. Lincoln. Since the last Presidential election certainly, perhaps since Senator Douglas' death, Mr. Sheahan left the Times; and the Times since then, has been identical with the Times before then, in little more than the name.<span class="ptr"><a name="6_251_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_251_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> The writer hereof is not well enough posted to say but that your article in other respects is correct.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADf, DLC-RTL. The article headed ``THE CHICAGO TIMES'' appeared in the <span class="rend-i">Daily Chronicle</span> for Saturday, June 6, 1863. Lincoln's anonymous letter, of which the above is obviously a first draft, appeared in the <span class="rend-i">Chronicle</span> on Sunday, June 7, considerably revised, or edited by the <span class="rend-i">Chronicle</span>, as follows:</p>
<p>``A correspondent corrects an error of date in the article in Saturday's CHRONICLE on the Chicago <span class="rend-i">Times</span>, and adds some items of interesting information. He says:</p>
<p>`` `Upon the repeal of the Missouri Compromise the democratic newspapers of Chicago went over to the Opposition. Thereupon the <span class="rend-i">Times</span> was established by the friends of the Administration, Senator Douglas being the most prominent in establishing it. Mr. James Sheahan, from this city, was its editor from its first foundation up to the election in 1860. On the political separation between Mr. Buchanan and Senator Douglas, the <span class="rend-i">Times</span> adhered to the Senator, and was the ablest paper in his support through his senatorial contest with Mr. Lincoln. During the last Presidential election Mr. Sheahan left the <span class="rend-i">Times</span>, which had been bought, as you state, by Mr. McCormick; and a man named McComas, a bitter pro-slavery man and a Virginian, became its editor. Sheahan<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;252</span>
for awhile edited the Springfield <span class="rend-i">Register</span>, and then went back to Chicago and established the <span class="rend-i">Post</span>, which he still conducts. From the period that the <span class="rend-i">Times</span> passed into its present hands it has borne little resemblance, but in name, to the <span class="rend-i">Times</span> which supported Senator Douglas in his contest with the corrupt and cowardly Administration of Mr. Buchanan.

<p>``The enclosed is a copy of an endorsement made by His Excellency the President, on a communication of mine to the Adjutant General of the Army in relation to the case of Mr. Robert LeRoy, formerly Assistant Adjutant General of Volunteers. The original communication with endorsement having been<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;255</span>

His name was not sent in for confirmation by the Senate, as it was withdrawn at my request.</p>
<p>``In my communication to the Adjutant General I expressed a desire to see Mr. LeRoy restored to his position of Assistant Adjutant General of Volunteers which I suppose could only be done by a re-appointment. I know from personal observation that Mr. LeRoy has not relapsed into any kind of dissipation and I still hope that he may receive a reappointment. In my command---comprised of the 1st.

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADfS, DLC-RTL. Hooker's telegram of June 10, 2:30 P.M., is as follows:</p>
<p>``General Pleasonton, by telegram . . . reports that he had an affair with the rebel cavalry yesterday near Brandy Station, which resulted in crippling him so much that he will have to abandon his contemplated raid into Maryland, which was to have started this morning.</p>
<p>``I am not so certain that the raid will be abandoned from this cause. It may delay the departure a few days. I shall leave the cavalry . . . where they are, near Bealeton, with instructions to resist the passage of the river by the enemy's forces. If to effect this he should bring up a considerable force of infantry, that will so much weaken him in my front that I have good reason to believe that I can throw a sufficient force over the river to compel the enemy to abandon his present position. If it should be the intention to send a heavy column of infantry to accompany the cavalry on the proposed raid, he can leave nothing behind to interpose any serious obstacle to my rapid advance on Richmond. I am not satisfied of his intention in this respect, but from certain movements in their corps I cannot regard it as altogether improbable. If it should be found to be the case, will it not promote the true interest of the cause for me to march to Richmond at once? From there all the disposable part of this army can be thrown to any threatened point north of the Potomac at short notice, and, until they can reach their destination, a sufficiency of troops can be collected to check, if not to stop, his invasion. If left to operate from my own judgment, with my present information, I do not hesitate to say that I should adopt this course as being the most speedy and certain mode of giving the<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;258</span>
rebellion a mortal blow. I desire that you will give it your reflection. At present the enemy has one corps of infantry at Gordonsville, with the advance at Culpeper, with the manifest tendency of other corps to drift in that direction. I now have two bridges across the Rappahannock, ready to spring over the river below Fredericksburg, and it is this, I believe, that causes the enemy to hesitate in moving forward.</p>
<p>``Major-General Dix informs me that he intends moving two columns up James River to-morrow; but if organized to correspond in numbers to the troops as they have of late been posted, neither column will be successful. The one on the north side of the river will be too small, and on the south side, with his whole column, I question if Richmond can be taken at all, provided 2,000 or 3,000 men could be assembled to defend it. The columns should unite at City Point, or below, and move on the north bank of that river.</p>
<p>``From information, which I deem reliable, the only troops remaining in Richmond is the provost-guard, 1,500, and all the troops between here and there are brought well to the front.</p>
<p>``It would be of incalculable service to this army to be transferred to some more remote point from Washington and Alexandria. The stampedes in those towns, gotten up, no doubt, by people in the rebel interest, have their influence on my men, for many of them have no means of knowing whether they are with or without cause. They think there must be some fire when there is so much smoke.''</p>
<p>On June 11, Halleck telegraphed Hooker, ``The President has just referred to me your telegram and his reply of yesterday, with directions to say to you whether or not I agree with him. I do so fully.'' (OR, I, XXVII, I, 35).</p>

<div class="opener">Executive Mansion<br>
Hon. Erastus Corning &amp; others Washington [June 12] 1863.</div>
<p>Gentlemen Your letter of May 19th. inclosing the resolutions of a public meeting held at Albany, N.Y. on the 16th. of the same month, was received several days ago.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;261</span>The resolutions, as I understand them, are resolvable into two propositions---first, the expression of a purpose to sustain the cause of the Union, to secure peace through victory, and to support the administration in every constitutional, and lawful measure to suppress the rebellion; and secondly, a declaration of censure upon the administration for supposed unconstitutional action such as the making of military arrests.</p>
<p>And, from the two propositions a third is deduced, which is, that the gentlemen composing the meeting are resolved on doing their part to maintain our common government and country, despite the folly or wickedness, as they may conceive, of any administration. This position is eminently patriotic, and as such, I thank the meeting, and congratulate the nation for it. My own purpose is the same; so that the meeting and myself have a common object, and can have no difference, except in the choice of means or measures, for effecting that object.</p>
<p>And here I ought to close this paper, and would close it, if there were no apprehension that more injurious consequences, than any merely personal to myself, might follow the censures systematically<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;262</span>
cast upon me for doing what, in my view of duty, I could not forbear. The resolutions promise to support me in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress the rebellion; and I have not knowingly employed, nor shall knowingly employ, any other. But the meeting, by their resolutions, assert and argue, that certain military arrests and proceedings following them for which I am ultimately responsible, are unconstitutional. I think they are not. The resolutions quote from the constitution, the definition of treason; and also the limiting safe-guards and guarrantees therein provided for the citizen, on trials for treason, and on his being held to answer for capital or otherwise infamous crimes, and, in criminal prossecutions, his right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury. They proceed to resolve ``That these safe-guards of the rights of the citizen against the pretentions of arbitrary power, were intended more <span class="rend-i">especially</span> for his protection in times of civil commotion.'' And, apparently, to demonstrate the proposition, the resolutions proceed ``They were secured substantially to the English people, <span class="rend-i">after</span> years of protracted civil war, and were adopted into our constitution at the <span class="rend-i">close</span> of the revolution.'' Would not the demonstration have been better, if it could have been truly said that these safe-guards had been adopted, and applied <span class="rend-i">during</span> the civil wars and <span class="rend-i">during</span> our revolution, instead of <span class="rend-i">after</span> the one, and at the <span class="rend-i">close</span> of the other. I too am devotedly for them <span class="rend-i">after</span> civil war, and <span class="rend-i">before</span> civil war, and at all times ``except when, in cases of Rebellion or Invasion, the public Safety may require'' their suspension. The resolutions proceed to tell us that these safe-guards ``have stood the test of seventysix years of trial, under our republican system, under circumstances which show that while they constitute the foundation of all free government, they are the elements of the enduring stability of the Republic.'' No one denies that they have so stood the test up to the beginning of the present rebellion if we except a certain matter [occurrence]<span class="ptr"><a name="6_262_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_262_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> at New-Orleans hereafter to be mentioned; nor does any one question that they will stand the same test much longer after the rebellion closes. But these provisions of the constitution have no application to the case we have in hand, because the arrests complained of were not made for treason---that is, not for <span class="rend-i">the</span> treason defined in the constitution, and upon the conviction of which, the punishment is death---- nor yet were they made to hold persons to answer for any capital, or otherwise infamous crimes; nor were the proceedings following, in any constitutional or legal sense, ``criminal prossecutions.'' The arrests were made on totally different grounds,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;263</span>
and the proceedings following, accorded with the grounds of the arrests. Let us consider the real case with which we are dealing, and apply to it the parts of the constitution plainly made for such cases.<span class="ptr"><a name="6_263_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_263_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[4]</a></span></p>
<p>Prior to my instalation here it had been inculcated that any State had a lawful right to secede from the national Union; and that it would be expedient to exercise the right, whenever the devotees of the doctrine should fail to elect a President to their own liking. I was elected contrary to their liking; and accordingly, so far as it was legally possible, they had taken seven states out of the Union, had seized many of the United States Forts, and had fired upon the United States' Flag, all before I was inaugerated; and, of course, before I had done any official act whatever. The rebellion, thus began soon ran into the present civil war;<span class="ptr"><a name="6_263_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_263_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[5]</a></span> and, in certain respects, it began on very unequal terms between the parties. The insurgents had been preparing for it more than thirty years, while the government had taken no steps to resist them. The former had carefully considered all the means which could be turned to their account. It undoubtedly was a well pondered reliance with them that in their own unrestricted effort to destroy Union, constitution, and law, all together, the government would, in great degree, be restrained by the same constitution and law, from arresting their progress. Their sympathizers pervaded all departments of the government, and nearly all communities of the people. From this material, under cover of ``Liberty of speech'' ``Liberty of the press'' and ``<span class="rend-i">Habeas corpus</span>'' they hoped to keep on foot amongst us a most efficient corps of spies, informers, supplyers, and aiders and abettors of their cause in a thousand ways. They knew that in times such as they were inaugerating, by the constitution itself, the ``Habeas corpus'' might be suspended; but they also knew they had friends who would make a question<span class="ptr"><a name="6_263_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_263_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[6]</a></span> as to <span class="rend-i">who</span> was to suspend it; meanwhile their spies and others might remain at large to help on their cause. Or if, as has happened, the executive should suspend the writ, without ruinous waste of time, instances of arresting innocent persons might occur, as are always likely to occur in such cases; and then a clamor<span class="ptr"><a name="6_263_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_263_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[7]</a></span> could be raised in regard to this, which might be, at least, of some service to the insurgent cause. It needed no very keen perception to discover<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;264</span>
this part of the enemies' programme, so soon as by open hostilities their machinery was fairly put in motion. Yet, thoroughly imbued with a reverence for the guarranteed rights of individuals, I was slow to adopt the strong measures, which by degrees I have been forced to regard as being within the exceptions of the constitution, and as indispensable to the public Safety. Nothing is better known to history than that courts of justice are utterly incompetent to such cases. Civil courts are organized chiefly for trials of individuals, or, at most, a few individuals acting in concert; and this in quiet times, and on charges of crimes well defined in the law. Even in times of peace, bands of horse-thieves and robbers frequently grow too numerous and powerful for the ordinary courts of justice. But what comparison, in numbers, have such bands ever borne to the insurgent sympathizers even in many of the loyal states? Again, a jury<span class="ptr"><a name="6_264_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_264_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[8]</a></span> too frequently have at least one member, more ready to hang the panel than to hang the traitor. And yet again, he who dissuades one man from volunteering, or induces one soldier to desert, weakens the Union cause as much as he who kills a union soldier in battle. Yet this dissuasion, or inducement, may be so conducted as to be no defined crime of which any civil court would take cognizance.</p>
<p>Ours is a case of Rebellion---so called by the resolutions before me---in fact, a clear, flagrant, and gigantic case of Rebellion; and the provision of the constitution that ``The previlege of the writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of Rebellion or Invasion, the public Safety may require it'' is <span class="rend-i">the</span> provision which specially applies to our present case. This provision plainly attests the understanding of those who made the constitution that ordinary courts of justice are inadequate to ``cases of Rebellion''---attests their purpose that in such cases, men<span class="ptr"><a name="6_264_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_264_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[9]</a></span> may be held in custody whom the courts acting on ordinary rules, would discharge. Habeas Corpus, does not discharge men who are proved to be guilty of defined crime; and its suspension is allowed by the constitution on purpose that, men may be arrested and held, who can not be proved to be guilty of defined crime, ``when, in cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.'' This is precisely our present case---a case of Rebellion, wherein the public Safety does require the suspension. Indeed, arrests by process of<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;265</span>
courts, and arrests in cases of rebellion, do not proceed altogether upon the same basis. The former is directed at the small per centage of ordinary and continuous perpetration of crime; while the latter is directed at sudden and extensive uprisings against the government, which, at most, will succeed or fail, in no great length of time. In the latter case, arrests are made, not so much for what has been done, as for what probably would be done. The latter is more for the preventive, and less for the vindictive, than the former. In such cases the purposes of men are much more easily understood, than in cases of ordinary crime. The man who stands by and says nothing, when the peril of his government is discussed, can not be misunderstood. If not hindered, he is sure to help the enemy. Much more, if he talks ambiguously---talks for his country with ``buts'' and ``ifs'' and ``ands.'' Of how little value the constitutional provision I have quoted will be rendered, if arrests shall never be made until defined crimes shall have been committed, may be illustrated by a few notable examples. Gen. John C. Breckienridge, Gen. Robert E. Lee, Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, Gen. John B. Magruder, Gen. William B. Preston, Gen. Simon B. Buckner, and Comodore [Franklin] Buchanan, now occupying the very highest places in the rebel war service, were all within the power of the government since the rebellion began, and were nearly as well known to be traitors then as now. Unquestionably if we had seized and held them, the insurgent cause would be much weaker. But no one of them had then committed any crime defined in the law. Every one of them if arrested would have been discharged on Habeas Corpus, were the writ allowed to operate. In view of these and similar cases, I think the time not unlikely to come when I shall be blamed for having made too few arrests rather than too many.</p>
<p>By the third resolution the meeting indicate their opinion that military arrests may be constitutional in localities where rebellion actually exists; but that such arrests are unconstitutional in localities where rebellion, or insurrection, does not actually exist. They insist that such arrests shall not be made ``outside of the lines of necessary military occupation, and the scenes of insurrection'' In asmuch, however, as the constitution itself makes no such distinction, I am unable to believe that there is any such constitutional distinction. I concede that the class of arrests complained of, can be constitutional only when, in cases of Rebellion or Invasion, the public Safety may require them; and I insist that in such cases, they are constitutional <span class="rend-i">wherever</span> the public safety does require them---as well in places to which they may prevent the rebellion extending,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;266</span>
as in those where it may be already prevailing---as well where they may restrain mischievous interference with the raising and supplying of armies, to suppress the rebellion, as where the rebellion may actually be---as well where they may restrain the enticing men out of the army, as where they would prevent mutiny in the army---equally constitutional at all places where they will conduce to the public Safety, as against the dangers of Rebellion or Invasion.</p>
<p>Take the particular case mentioned by the meeting. They assert [It is asserted]<span class="ptr"><a name="6_266_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_266_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[10]</a></span> in substance that Mr. Vallandigham was by a military commander, seized and tried ``for no other reason than words addressed to a public meeting, in criticism of the course of the administration, and in condemnation of the military orders of that general'' Now, if there be no mistake about this---if this assertion is the truth and the whole truth---if there was no other reason for the arrest, then I concede that the arrest was wrong. But the arrest, as I understand, was made for a very different reason. Mr. Vallandigham avows his hostility to the war on the part of the Union; and his arrest was made because he was laboring, with some effect, to prevent the raising of troops, to encourage desertions from the army, and to leave the rebellion without an adequate military force to suppress it. He was not arrested because he was damaging the political prospects of the administration, or the personal interests of the commanding general; but because he was damaging the army, upon the existence, and vigor of which, the life of the nation depends. He was warring upon the military; and this gave the military constitutional jurisdiction to lay hands upon him. If Mr. Vallandigham was not damaging the military power of the country, then his arrest was made on mistake of fact, which I would be glad to correct, on reasonably satisfactory evidence.</p>
<p>I understand the meeting, whose resolutions I am considering, to be in favor of suppressing the rebellion by military force---by armies. Long experience has shown that armies can not be maintained unless desertion shall be punished by the severe penalty of death. The case requires, and the law and the constitution, sanction this punishment. Must I shoot a simple-minded soldier boy who deserts, while I must not touch a hair of a wiley agitator who induces him to desert? This is none the less injurious when effected by getting a father, or brother, or friend, into a public meeting, and there working upon his feeling, till he is persuaded to write the soldier boy, that he is fighting in a bad cause, for a wicked administration of a contemptable government, too weak to arrest<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;267</span>
and punish him if he shall desert. I think that in such a case, to silence the agitator, and save the boy, is not only constitutional, but, withal, a great mercy.<span class="ptr"><a name="6_267_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_267_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[11]</a></span></p>
<p>If I be wrong on this question of constitutional power, my error lies in believing that certain proceedings are constitutional when, in cases of rebellion or Invasion, the public Safety requires them, which would not be constitutional when, in absence of rebellion or invasion, the public Safety does not require them---in other words, that the constitution is not in it's application in all respects the same, in cases of Rebellion or invasion, involving the public Safety, as it is in times of profound peace and public security. The constitution itself makes the distinction; and I can no more be persuaded that the government can constitutionally take no strong measure in time of rebellion, because it can be shown that the same could not be lawfully taken in time of peace, than I can be persuaded that a particular drug is not good medicine for a sick man, because it can be shown to not be good food for a well one. Nor am I able to appreciate the danger, apprehended by the meeting, that the American people will, by means of military arrests during the rebellion, lose the right of public discussion, the liberty of speech and the press, the law of evidence, trial by jury, and Habeas corpus, throughout the indefinite peaceful future which I trust lies before them, any more than I am able to believe that a man could contract so strong an appetite for emetics during temporary illness,<span class="ptr"><a name="6_267_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_267_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[12]</a></span> as to persist in feeding upon them through the remainder of his healthful life.</p>
<p>In giving the resolutions that earnest consideration which you request of me, I can not overlook the fact that the meeting speak as ``Democrats.'' Nor can I, with full respect for their known intelligence, and the fairly presumed deliberation with which they prepared their resolutions, be permitted to suppose that this occurred by accident, or in any way other than that they preferred to designate themselves ``democrats'' rather than ``American citizens.'' In this time of national peril I would have preferred to meet you upon a level one step higher than any party platform; because I am sure that from such more elevated position, we could do better battle for the country we all love, than we possibly can from those lower ones, where from the force of habit, the prejudices of the past, and selfish hopes of the future, we are sure to expend much of our ingenuity and strength, in finding fault with, and<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;268</span>
aiming blows at each other. But since you have denied me this, I will yet be thankful, for the country's sake, that not all democrats have done so. He on whose discretionary judgment Mr. Vallandigham was arrested and tried, is a democrat, having no old party affinity with me; and the judge who rejected the constitutional view expressed in these resolutions, by refusing to discharge Mr. V. on Habeas Corpus, is a democrat of better days than these, having received his judicial mantle at the hands of President Jackson. And still more, of all those democrats who are nobly exposing their lives and shedding their blood on the battle-field, I have learned that many approve the course taken with Mr. V. while I have not heard of a single one condemning it. I can not assert that there are none such.</p>
<p>And<span class="ptr"><a name="6_268_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_268_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[13]</a></span> the name of President Jackson recalls a bit [an instance]<span class="ptr"><a name="6_268_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_268_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[14]</a></span> of pertinent history. After the battle of New-Orleans, and while the fact that the treaty of peace had been concluded, was well known in the city, but before official knowledge of it had arrived, Gen. Jackson still maintained martial, or military law. Now, that it could be said the war was over, the clamor against martial law, which had existed from the first, grew more furious. Among other things a Mr. Louiallier<span class="ptr"><a name="6_268_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_268_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[15]</a></span> published a denunciatory newspaper article. Gen. Jackson arrested him. A lawyer by the name of Morel<span class="ptr"><a name="6_268_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_268_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[16]</a></span> procured the U.S. Judge Hall<span class="ptr"><a name="6_268_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_268_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[17]</a></span> to order a writ of Habeas Corpus to release Mr. Louiallier. Gen. Jackson arrested both the lawyer and the judge. A Mr. Hollander<span class="ptr"><a name="6_268_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_268_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[18]</a></span> ventured to say of some part of the matter that ``it was a dirty trick.'' Gen. Jackson arrested him. When the officer undertook to serve the writ of Habeas Corpus, Gen. Jackson took it from him, and sent him away with a copy. Holding the judge in custody a few days, the general sent him beyond the limits of his encampment, and set him at liberty, with an order to remain till the ratification of peace should be regularly announced, or until the British should have left the Southern coast. A day or two more elapsed, the ratification of the treaty of peace was regularly announced, and the judge and others were fully liberated. A few days more, and the judge called Gen. Jackson into court and fined him a thousand dollars, for having arrested him and the others named. The general paid the fine, and there the matter rested for nearly thirty years, when congress refunded principal and interest. The late Senator Douglas, then in<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;269</span>
the House of Representatives, took a leading part in the debate, in which the constitutional question was much discussed. I am not prepared to say whom the Journals would show to have voted for the measure.</p>
<p>It may be remarked: First, that we had the same constitution then, as now. Secondly, that we then had a case of Invasion, and that now we have a case of Rebellion, and: Thirdly, that the permanent right of the people to public discussion, the liberty of speech and the press, the trial by jury, the law of evidence, and the Habeas Corpus, suffered no detriment whatever by that conduct of Gen. Jackson, or it's subsequent approval by the American congress.</p>
<p>And yet, let me say that in my own discretion, I do not know whether I would have ordered the arrest of Mr. V. While I can not shift the responsibility from myself, I hold that, as a general rule, the commander in the field is the better judge of the necessity in any particular case. Of course I must practice a general directory and revisory power in the matter.</p>
<p>One of the resolutions expresses the opinion of the meeting that arbitrary arrests will have the effect to divide and distract those who should be united in suppressing the rebellion; and I am specifically called on to discharge Mr. Vallandigham. I regard this as, at least, a fair appeal to me, on the expediency of exercising a constitutional power which I think exists. In response to such appeal I have to say it gave me pain when I learned that Mr. V. had been arrested,---that is,<span class="ptr"><a name="6_269_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_269_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[19]</a></span> I was pained that there should have seemed to be a necessity for arresting him---and that it will afford me great pleasure to discharge him so soon as I can, by any means, believe the public safety will not suffer by it. I further say, that as the war progress, it appears to me, opinion, and action, which were in great confusion at first, take shape, and fall into more regular channels; so that the necessity for arbitrary [strong]<span class="ptr"><a name="6_269_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_269_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[20]</a></span> dealing with them gradually decreases. I have every reason to desire that it would cease altogether; and far from the least is my regard for the opinions and wishes of those who, like the meeting at Albany, declare their purpose to sustain the government in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress the rebellion. Still,<span class="ptr"><a name="6_269_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_269_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[21]</a></span> I must continue to do so much as may seem to be required by the public safety. A. LINCOLN.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADf, DLC-RTL; New York <span class="rend-i">Tribune</span>, June 15, 1863. The autograph draft in the LINCOLN Papers lacks certain revisions which LINCOLN must have made in the copy prepared for the press, as well as in the original letter sent to Corning, which has not been located. The draft has been followed, with LINCOLN's significant emendations as they appear in the draft and those additional ones which appear in the text of the <span class="rend-i">Tribune</span> indicated in footnotes. The cover page of the draft bears LINCOLN's endorsement, ``Albany letter Manuscript &amp; something about Proclamation.'' The other manuscript referred to has not been located.</p>
<p>On June 23, Corning acknowledged receipt of LINCOLN's letter, ``I have deemed it proper to hand your communication to the Committee who reported the Resolutions, for such action as in their judgment, the case may seem to demand. . . .'' (DLC-RTL). On June 30, Corning and the committee conveyed their reply, which reads in part: `` . . . We have carefully considered the grounds on which your pretensions to more than regal authority are claimed to rest; and if we do not misinterpret the misty and clouded forms of expression in which those pretensions are set forth, your meaning is that while the rights of the citizen are protected by the Constitution in time of peace, they are suspended or lost in time of war, or when invasion or rebellion exist. You do not, like many others in whose minds, reason and love of regulated liberty seem to be overthrown by the excitements of the hour, attempt to base this conclusion upon a supposed military necessity existing outside of and transcending the Constitution, a military necessity behind which the Constitution itself disappears in a total eclipse. We do not find this gigantic and monstrous heresy put forth in your plea for absolute power, but we do find another equally subversive of liberty and law, and quite as certainly tending to the establishment of despotism. Your claim to have found not outside, but within the Constitution, a principle or germ of arbitrary power, which in time of war expands at once into an absolute sovereignty, wielded by one man; so that liberty perishes, or is dependent on his will, his discretion or his caprice. This extraordinary doctrine, you claim to derive wholly from that clause of the Constitution, which, in case of invasion or rebellion, permits the writ of habeas corpus to be suspended. Upon this ground your whole argument is based.</p>
<p>``You must permit us, to say to you with all due respect, but with the earnestness demanded by the occasion, that the American people will never acquiese in this doctrine. . . .'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>.).</p>

I certainly do not suppose Mr. Edwards has, at this time of his life, given up his old habits, and turned dishonest; and while I have not known Mr. Bailhasche so long, I have no more affermative reason to suspect him. The trouble with me is of a different character. Sprinfield is my home, and there, more than elsewhere, are my life-long friends. These, for now nearly two years, have been harrassing me because of Mr. E. &amp; Mr. B. I think Mr. E. &amp; Mr. B. without dishonesty on the other hand, could have saved me from this, if they had cared to do<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;276</span>
so. They have seemed to think that if they could keep their official record dryly correct, to say the least, it was not any difference how much they might provoke my friends, and harrass me.

Hooker's telegram from Fairfax Station, June 15, received at 1:15 A.M. on the 16th, is as follows: ``I have received your despatch of this evening. The army of the Potomac is in this vicinity, excepting the 2nd and 6th corps, and, as they are marching in rear of all the trains, they will not be up before some time during to-morrow. Perhaps the 2d corps will not be here until some time to-morrow night. The 1st and 11th corps were first to arrive on this line, but I have not yet learned whether they have drawn their supplies in readiness to march to-morrow morning or not. As soon as they are provided, they, as well as the others, will be put <span class="rend-i">en route</span>. I have been informed that the enemy nowhere crossed the Rappahannock on our withdrawal from it. But General Hill's troops moved up the river in the direction of Culpeper this morning, for the purpose of, I conclude, re-enforcing Longstreet and Ewell, wherever they may be. I request that I may be informed what troops there are at Harper's Ferry, and who is in command of them, and also who is in command in this district.'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>., p. 265).</p>
<p>Hooker's later telegram, received at 8:35 A.M., is as follows: ``It appears to me . . . that nearly all of the cavalry of the army of the Potomac should at once be sent into Maryland by the most direct route. General Stahl has an abundance to perform all cavalry duty that will be required south of the Potomac. I merely make this suggestion. If any considerable body of the enemy's infantry should be thrown across the Potomac, they will probably take the direction of his advance pickets, and, in that event, it seems to me that a heavy column of ours should be thrown as speedily as possible to cross the river at Harper's Ferry, while another should be thrown over the most direct line<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;281</span>
covering Baltimore and Philadelphia. I only speak with reference to this army, as I know nothing of the location or numbers of troops at the disposal of the government elsewhere.'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>.).</p>

<p>My dear General: I send you this by the hand of Captain Dahlgren.<span class="ptr"><a name="6_281_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_281_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> FOOTNOTES}&gt;(2) Your despatch of 11:30 A.M. to-day is just received. When you say I have long been aware that you do not enjoy the confidence of the major-general commanding, you state the case much too strongly.</p>
<p>You do not lack his confidence in any degree to do you any harm. On seeing him, after telegraphing you this morning, I found him more nearly agreeing with you than I was myself. Surely you do not mean to understand that I am withholding my confidence from you when I happen to express an opinion (certainly never discourteously) differing from one of your own.</p>
<p>I believe Halleck is dissatisfied with you to this extent only, that he knows that you write and telegraph (``report,'' as he calls it) to me. I think he is wrong to find fault with this; but I do not think he withholds any support from you on account of it. If you and he would use the same frankness to one another, and to me, that I use to both of you, there would be no difficulty. I need and must have the professional skill of both, and yet these suspicions tend to deprive me of both.</p>
<p>I believe you are aware that since you took command of the army I have not believed you had any chance to effect anything till now. As it looks to me, Lee's now returning toward Harper's Ferry gives you back the chance that I thought McClellan lost last fall. Quite possibly I was wrong both then and now; but, in the great responsibility resting upon me, I cannot be entirely silent. Now, all I ask is that you will be in such mood that we can get into our action the best cordial judgment of yourself and General Halleck, with my poor mite added, if indeed he and you shall think it entitled to any consideration at all. Yours as ever,</p>
<p>A. LINCOLN.</p>

<p>Gentlemen Your letter, which follows, has been received, and considered.</p>
<p>``To His Excellency Abraham Lincoln</p>
<p>President of the United States:</p>
<p>The undersigned, a committee appointed by the Planters of the State of Louisiana, respectfully represent, that they have been<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;288</span>
delegated to seek of the General Government a full recognition of all the rights of the State, as they existed previous to the passage of an act of secession, upon the principle of the existence of the State Constitution unimpaired, and no legal act having transpired that could in any way deprive them of the advantages conferred by that Constitution. Under this constitution the State wishes to return to its full allegiance, in the enjoyment of all rights and privileges exercised by the other states under the Federal Constitution. With the view of accomplishing the desired object, we farther request that your Excellency will as Commander-in-chief of the Army of the United States direct the military Governor of Louisiana to order an election in conformity with the constitution and laws of the State, on the first Monday of November next, for all State and Federal Officers.</p>
<p>``With high consideration and respect we have the honor to subscribe ourselves Your Obt Servts. E. E. MALHIOT</p>
<p>BRADISH JOHNSON</p>
<p>THOMAS COTTMAN.''</p>
<p>Since receiving the letter, reliable information has reached me that a respectable portion of the Louisiana people desire to amend their State constitution, and contemplate holding a convention for that object. This fact alone, as it seems to me, is a sufficient reason why the general government should not give the committal you seek, to the existing State constitution. I may add that, while I do not perceive how such committal could facilitate our military operations in Louisiana, I really apprehend it might be so used as to embarrass them.</p>
<p>As to an election to be held next November, there is abundant time, without any order, or proclamation from me just now. The people of Louisiana shall not lack an oppertunity of a fair election for both Federal and State officers, by want of anything within my power to give them. Your Obt. Servt. A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADfS and LS copy, DLC-RTL. The original letter from Malhiot, Johnson, and Cottman is undated, but it was presented to Lincoln prior to Monday, June 15. On June 18, Thomas Cottman wrote Lincoln as follows: ``My colleagues have departed leaving me to receive the response that your Excellency was kind enough to promise us for Monday last. I hope it will not be regarded as impertinent to ask attention to the matter at earliest convenience. . . .'' (DLC-RTL). The meeting of planters at New Orleans, which appointed the committee to present Lincoln with their request, was held on May 1, at the St. Charles Hotel, and the letter was probably delivered by the committee prior to June 1. On June 6, Michael Hahn wrote Lincoln, ``The Union people of this State (except, of course, office-holders) are all in favor of a re-organization of a loyal State government. The only question on which they are divided is as to whether a new Constitution should be made, or the old Constitution of 1852 adhered to. Those in favor of a Convention and a new Constitution are<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;289</span></p>

Others, whose interests are in . . . slavery . . . are strongly opposed . . . and are satisfied with the Constitution of 1852, which unjustly gives the country parishes a very large preponderance over the City in the number of members of the legislature. . . .''

<div class="opener">Gen. John M. Schofield. Executive Mansion,<br>
My dear Sir: Washington, June 22, 1863.</div>
<p>Your despatch, asking in substance, whether, in case Missouri shall adopt gradual emancipation, the general government will protect slave owners in that species of property during the short time it shall be permitted by the State to exist within it, has been received. Desirous as I am, that emancipation shall be adopted by Missouri, and believing as I do, that <span class="rend-i">gradual</span> can be made better than <span class="rend-i">immediate</span> for both black and white, except when military necessity changes the case, my impulse is to say that such protection would be given. I can not know exactly what shape an act of emancipation may take. If the period from the initiation to the final end, should be comparatively short, and the act should prevent persons being sold, during that period, into more lasting slavery, the whole would be easier. I do not wish to pledge the general government to the affirmative support of even temporary slavery, beyond what can be fairly claimed under the constitution. I suppose, however, this is not desired; but that it is desired for the Military force of the United States, while in Missouri, to not be used in subverting the temporarily reserved legal rights in slaves during the progress of emancipation. This I would desire also. I have very earnestly urged the slave-states to adopt emancipation; and it ought to be, and is an object with me not to overthrow, or thwart what any of them may in good faith do, to that end.</p>
<p>You are therefore authorized to act in the spirit of this letter, in conjunction with what may appear to be the military necessities of your Department.</p>
<p>Although this letter will become public at some time, it is not intended to be made so now. Yours truly A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>Gentlemen: The resolutions of the Ohio Democratic State convention which you present me, together with your introductory and closing remarks, being in position and argument, mainly the</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;301</span><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;302</span>same as the resolutions of the Democratic meeting at Albany, New-York, I refer you to my response to the latter, as meeting most of the points in the former. This response you evidently used in preparing your remarks, and I desire no more than that it be used with accuracy. In a single reading of your remarks I only discovered one inaccuracy in matter which I suppose you took from that paper. It is when you say ``The undersigned are unable to agree with you in the opinion you have expressed that the constitution is different in time of insurrection or invasion from what it is in time of peace &amp; public security.'' A recurrence to the paper will show you that I have not expressed the opinion you suppose. I expressed the opinion that the constitution is different, <span class="rend-i">in its application</span> in cases of Rebellion or Invasion, involving the Public Safety, from what it is in times of profound peace and public security; and this opinion I adhere to, simply because, by the constitution itself, things may be done in the one case which may not be done in the other.</p>
<p>I dislike to waste a word on a merely personal point; but I must respectfully assure you that you will find yourselves at fault should you ever seek for evidence to prove your assumption that I ``opposed, in discussions before the people, the policy of the Mexican war.''</p>
<p>You say ``Expunge from the constitution this limitation upon the power of congress to suspend the writ of Habeas corpus, and yet the other guarranties of personal liberty would remain unchanged'' Doubless if this clause of the constitution, improperly called, as I think, a limitation upon the power of congress, were expunged, the other guarranties would remain the same; but the question is, not how those guarranties would stand, with that clause <span class="rend-i">out</span> of the constitution, but how they stand with that clause remaining in it---in cases of Rebellion or Invasion, involving the public Safety. If the liberty could be indulged, of expunging that clause letter &amp; spirit, I really think the constitutional argument would be with you. My general view on this question was stated in the Albany response, and hence I do not state it now. I only add that, as seems to me, the benefit of the writ of Habeas corpus, is the great means through which the guarranties of personal liberty are conserved, and made available in the last resort; and coroborative of this view, is the fact that Mr. V. in the very case in question, under the advice of able lawyers, saw not where else to go but to the Habeas Corpus. But by the constitution the benefit of the writ of Habeas corpus itself may be suspended when in cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;303</span>You ask, in substance, whether I really claim that I may override all the guarrantied rights of individuals, on the plea of conserving the public safety---when I may choose to say the public safety requires it. This question, divested of the phraseology calculated to represent me as struggling for an arbitrary personal prerogative, is either simply a question <span class="rend-i">who</span> shall decide, or an affirmation that <span class="rend-i">nobody</span> shall decide, what the public safety does require, in cases of Rebellion or Invasion. The constitution contemplates the question as likely to occur for decision, but it does not expressly declare who is to decide it. By necessary implication, when Rebellion or Invasion comes, the decision is to be made, from time to time; and I think the man whom, for the time, the people have, under the constitution, made the commander-in-chief, of their Army and Navy, is the man who holds the power, and bears the responsibility of making it. If he uses the power justly, the same people will probably justify him; if he abuses it, he is in their hands, to be dealt with by all the modes they have reserved to themselves in the constitution.</p>
<p>The<span class="ptr"><a name="6_303_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_303_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> earnestness with which you insist that persons can only, in times of rebellion, be lawfully dealt with, in accordance with the rules for criminal trials and punishments in times of peace, induces me to add a word to what I said on that point, in the Albany response. You claim that men may, if they choose, embarrass those whose duty it is, to combat a giant rebellion, and then be dealt with in turn, only as if there was no rebellion. The constitution itself rejects this view. The military arrests and detentions, which have been made, including those of Mr. V. which are not different in principle from the others, have been for <span class="rend-i">prevention</span>, and not for <span class="rend-i">punishment</span>---as injunctions to stay injury, as proceedings to keep the peace---and hence, like proceedings in such cases, and for like reasons, they have not been accompanied with indictments, or trials by juries, nor, in a single case by any punishment whatever, beyond what is purely incidental to the prevention. The original sentence of imprisonment in Mr. V.'s case, was to prevent injury to the Military service only, and the modification of it was made as a less disagreeable mode to him, of securing the same prevention.</p>
<p>I am unable to perceive an insult to Ohio in the case of Mr. V. Quite surely nothing of the sort was or is intended. I was wholly unaware that Mr. V. was at the time of his arrest<span class="ptr"><a name="6_303_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_303_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[4]</a></span> a candidate for the democratic nomination for Governor until so informed by your<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;304</span>
reading to me the resolutions of the convention. I am grateful to the State of Ohio for many things, especially for the brave soldiers and officers she has given in the present national trial, to<span class="ptr"><a name="6_304_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_304_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[5]</a></span> the armies of the Union.</p>
<p>You claim, as I understand, that according to my own position in the Albany response, Mr. V. should be released; and this because, as you claim, he has not damaged the military service, by discouraging enlistments, encouraging desertions, or otherwise; and that if he had, he should have been turned over to the civil authorities under recent acts of congress. I certainly do not <span class="rend-i">know</span> that Mr. V. has specifically, and by direct language, advised against enlistments, and in favor of desertion, and resistance to drafting. We all know that combinations, armed in some instances, to resist the arrest of deserters, began several months ago; that more recently the like has appeared in resistance to the enrolment preparatory to a draft; and that quite a number of assassinations have occurred from the same animus. These had to be met by military force, and this again has led to bloodshed and death. And now under a sense of responsibility more weighty and enduring than any which is merely official, I solemnly declare my belief that this hindrance, of the military, including maiming and murder, is due to the course in which Mr. V. has been engaged, in a greater degree than to any other cause; and is due to him personally, in a greater degree than to any other one man. These things have been notorious, known to all, and of course known to Mr. V. Perhaps I would not be wrong to say they originated with his special friends and adhereants. With perfect knowledge of them, he has frequently, if not constantly made speeches, in congress, and before popular assemblies; and if it can be shown that, with these things staring him, in the face, he has ever uttered a word of rebuke, or counsel against them, it will be a fact greatly in his favor with me, and one of which, as yet I, am totally ignorant. When it is known that that [<span class="rend-i">sic</span>] the whole burthen of his speeches has been to stir up men against the prossecution of the war, and that in the midst of resistance to it, he has not been known, in any instance, to counsel against such resistance, it is next to impossible to repel the inference that he has counselled directly in favor of it. With all this before their eyes the convention you represent have nominated Mr. V. for Governor of Ohio; and both they and you, have declared the purpose to sustain the national Union by all constitutional<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;305</span>
means. But, of course, they and you, in common, reserve to yourselves to decide what are constitutional means; and, unlike the Albany meeting, you omit to state, or intimate, that in your opinion, an army is a constitutional means of saving the Union against a rebellion; or even to intimate that you are conscious of an existing rebellion being in progress with the avowed object of destroying that very Union. At the same time your nominee for Governor, in whose behalf you appeal, is known to you, and to the world, to declare against the use of an army to suppress the rebellion. Your own attitude, therefore, encourages desertion, resistance to the draft and the like, because it teaches those who incline to desert, and to escape the draft, to believe it is your purpose to protect them, and to hope that you will become strong enough to do so. After a short personal intercourse with you gentlemen of the committee, I can not say I think you desire this effect to follow your attitude; but I assure you that both friends and enemies of the Union look upon it in this light. It is a substantial hope, and by consequence, a real strength to the enemy. If it is a false hope, and one which you would willingly dispel, I will make the way exceedingly easy. I send you duplicates of this letter, in order that you, or a majority of you, may if you choose, indorse your names upon one of them, and return it thus indorsed to me, with the understanding that those signing, are thereby committed to the following propositions, and to nothing else.</p>
<p>1. That there is now a rebellion in the United States, the object and tendency of which is to destroy the national Union; and that in your opinion, an army and navy are constitutional means for suppressing that rebellion.</p>
<p>2. That no one of you will do any thing which in his own judgment, will tend to hinder the increase, or favor the decrease, or lessen the efficiency of the army or navy, while engaged in the effort to suppress that rebellion; and,</p>
<p>3. That each of you will, in his sphere, do all he can to have the officers, soldiers, and seamen of the army and navy, while engaged in the effort to suppress the rebellion, paid, fed, clad, and otherwise well provided and supported.</p>
<p>And with the further understanding that upon receiving the letter and names thus indorsed, I will cause them to be published, which publication shall be within itself, a revocation of the order in relation to Mr. V.<span class="ptr"><a name="6_305_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_305_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[6]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;306</span>It will not escape observation that I consent to the release of Mr. V. upon terms, not embracing any pledge from him, or from others as to what he will, or will not do. I do this because he is not present to speak for himself, or to authorize others to speak for him; and because I should expect that on his returning, he would not put himself practically in antagonism with the position of his friends. But I do it chiefly because I thereby preval on other influential gentlemen of Ohio to so define their position, as to be of immense value to the Army---thus more than compensating for the consequences of any mistake in allowing Mr. V. to return; and so that, on the whole, the public safety will not have suffered by it. Still, in regard to Mr. V. and all others, I must hereafter as heretofore, do so much as the public safety may seem to require. I<span class="ptr"><a name="6_306_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_306_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[7]</a></span> have the honor to be respectfully yours, &amp;c., A.

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADf, DLC-RTL. Following the delegation's arrival in Washington on the evening of June 24, Secretary Chase wrote LINCOLN the next day, ``to suggest that what is said to them or replied to them should be only in writing.'' (DLC-RTL). They were given an interview on the 25th, at which LINCOLN suggested that they present their request in writing. The letter from the delegation on June 26, presenting resolutions adopted by the Democratic state convention at Columbus on June 11, considerably abridged, is as follows:</p>
<p>``Resolved</p>
<p>``1st. That the will of the people is the foundation of all free government. That to give effect to this will, free thought, free speech and a free press are absolutely indispensable. . . .</p>
<p>``2d. That it is an inherent and constitutional right of the people to discuss all measures of their government, and to approve or disapprove. . . .</p>
<p>``3d. That these and all other rights, guaranteed to them by their constitutions, are their rights in time of war as well as in time of peace. . . .</p>
<p>``4th. That we now say . . . calmly, and firmly, that we will not surrender these rights, nor submit to their forcible violation. We will obey the laws ourselves and all others must obey them.</p>
<p>``5th. That Ohio will adhere to the Constitution and the Union as the best, it may be the last hope of popular freedom. . . .</p>
<p>``6th. That we will earnestly support every constitutional measure tending to preserve the Union. . . .</p>
<p>``7. That the arrest, imprisonment, pretended trial, and actual banishment of Clement L. Vallandigham . . . we regard as a palpable violation of the . . . Constitution. . . .</p>
<p>``8th. That Clement L Vallandigham was at the time of his arrest, a prominent candidate for nomination by the Democratic party of Ohio for the office of Governor of the State; that the Democratic party was fully competent to decide whether he was a fit man for that nomination; and that the attempt to deprive them of that right by his arrest and banishment was an unmerited imputation upon their intelligence and loyalty, as well as a violation of the Constitution.</p>
<p>``9th. That we respectfully and most earnestly call upon the President of the United States to restore Clement L. Vallandigham to his home in Ohio. . . .</p>
<p>``The undersigned. . . . do not call upon your Excellency as Suppliants praying the revocation of the order . . . as a favor, but by the authority of a Convention representing a majority of the Citizens of . . . Ohio. They respectfully ask it as a right due to an American Citizen in whose personal injury, the Sovereignty and dignity of the people of Ohio as a free State have been offended. . . .</p>
<p>``You are reported to have used in a public communication on this subject, the following language 'It gave me pain when I learned that Mr. Vallandigham had been arrested---that is I was pained that there should have seemed to be a necessity for arresting him, and that it will afford me great pleasure to discharge him so soon as I can by any means believe the public safety will not suffer by it.[']</p>
<p>``The undersigned assure your Excellency . . . that the public safety will be far more endangered by continuing Mr. Vallandigham in exile than by releasing him. . . .</p>
<p>``If a man . . . believes that from the inherent nature of the federal compact, the war . . . cannot be used as a means of restoring the Union . . . but would inevitably result in the final destruction of both the constitution and the Union, is he not to be allowed the right . . . to appeal to the judgment of the people, for a change of policy, by the constitutional remedy of the ballot box?</p>
<p>``During the war with Mexico many of the political opponents of the Administration . . . thought it their duty to denounce and oppose the war . . . with equal reason it might have been said of them, that their discussions before the people were calculated to discourage enlistments, 'to prevent the raising of troops' &amp; to induce desertions. . . .</p>
<p>``When gentlemen of high standing . . . including your Excellency opposed in discussions before the people, the policy of the Mexican War, were they 'warring upon the Military' &amp; did this 'give the Military constitutional jurisdiction to lay hands upon them?' . . .</p>
<p>``The undersigned are unable to agree with you in the opinion you have expressed that the constitution is different in time of insurrection or invasion from what it is, in time of peace &amp; public security. The constitution provides for no limitations upon . . . the guaranties of personal liberty, except as to the writ of habeas corpus. . . . Expunge from the constitution this limitation upon the power of Congress to suspend the writ of habeas corpus and yet the other guaranties of personal liberty would remain unchanged. . . . Does your Excellency wish to have it understood that you hold, that the rights of every man throughout this vast country are subject to be annulled whenever you may say that you consider the public safety requires it, in time of insurrection or invasion? . . .</p>
<p>``The people of Ohio, are willing to co---operate zealously with you in every effort warranted by the Constitution to restore the Union . . . but they cannot consent to abandon those fundamental principles of civil liberty, which are essential to their existence as a free people. In their name we ask, that by a revocation of the order of his banishment, Mr. Vallandigham, may be restored to the enjoyment of those rights of which they believe, he has been unconstitutionally deprived.''

The Committee cannot refrain from the expression of their surprise, that the President should make the fate of Mr. Vallandigham depend upon the opinion of this Committee, upon these propositions. If the arrest and banishment were legal and were deserved,---if the President exercised a power clearly delegated, under circumstances which warranted its exercise, the order ought not to be revoked, merely because the Committee hold or express opinions accordant with those of the President. . . . The opinion of the undersigned, touching the questions involved in these propositions, are well known, have been many times publicly expressed, and are sufficiently manifested in the resolution of the Convention, which they represent, and they cannot suppose that the President expects, that they will seek the discharge of Mr. Vallandigham, by a pledge, implying not only an imputation upon their own <span class="rend-i">sincerity</span> and <span class="rend-i">fidelity</span> as Citizens of the United States, but also carrying with it by implication a concession of the <span class="rend-i">legality</span> of his arrest, trial and banishment,---against which, they . . . have solemnly protested. And while they have asked the revocation of the order . . . not as <span class="rend-i">a favor</span>, but as <span class="rend-i">a right</span> due to the people of Ohio, . . . they do not do this, nor does Mr. Vallandigham desire it, at any sacrifice of their dignity and self respect. The idea, that such a pledge, as that asked . . . would secure the public safety sufficiently to compensate for any mistake of the President in discharging Mr. Vallandigham, is, in their opinion, a mere evasion of the grave questions involved in this discussion, and of a direct answer to their demand. And this is made especially apparent by the fact, that this pledge is asked in [a] communication which concludes with an intimation of a disposition on the part of the President to repeat the acts complained of.</p>

<div class="opener">Hon. Wm. Kellogg. Executive Mansion,<br>
My dear Sir: Washington, June 29. 1863.</div>
<p>I have received, and read, your pencil note. I think you do not know how embarrassing your request is. Few things are so troublesome to the government as the fierceness with which the profits of trading in cotten are sought. The temptation is so great that nearly every body wishes to be in it; and when in, the question of profit controls all, regardless of whether the cotten seller is loyal or rebel, or whether he is paid in corn-meal or gun-powder. The officers of the army, in numerous instances, are believed to connive and share the profits, and thus the army itself is diverted from fighting the rebels to speculating in cotten; and steam-boats and wagons in the pay of the government, are set to gathering and carrying cotten, and the soldiers to loading cotten-trains and guarding them.</p>
<p>The matter deeply affects the Treasury and War Departments, and has been discussed again and again in the cabinet. What can, and what can not be done, has, for the time been settled, and it seems to me I can not safely break over it. I know it is thought that one case is not much, but how can I favor one and deny another. One case can not be kept a secret. The authority given would be utterly ineffectual until it is shown; and when shown, every body knows of it. The administration would do for you as much as for any other man; and I personally would do some more than for most others; but really I can not involve myself and the Government as this would do. Yours as ever A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADfS, DLC-RTL. See Lincoln to Chase, June 25, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>. Kellogg's note of June 29 is as follows:</p>
<p>``The reply of Mr. Chase to me on reading your note and hearing my proposition was `It can not be done Sir' an iceburg would be as a furnace compared to your Sec of the Treasury.</p>
<p>``Mr. Lincoln---I very much desire that Mr. A[mos] C Babcock be permitted to take to and sell ordinary articles of commerce at Helena, Arkansas---not `contraband of war' and to buy of loyal men cotton &amp; other productions---at that place and Fryers Point Miss. &amp; transport northward. If in your judgment there is nothing wrong in this <span class="rend-i">I do think</span> the administration should grant me this much</p>
<p>``I do not know of any consideration that would induce me again to ask a favour of Mr Chase. If I can not get this of the Commander in Chief---of the armies---I can not get it at all I dislike to trouble you but will ask you to consider the matter. . . .</p>
<p>``If this can not be done, will the govt. permit certain persons <span class="rend-i">loyal men</span> who have raised and own cotton who may be named to ship <span class="rend-i">themselves</span> their cotton to St Louis or other points. This would <span class="rend-i">answer</span> my purpose'' (DLC-RTL).</p>

Major General Milroy Executive Mansion,<br>
My dear Sir: Washington, June 29. 1863.</div>
<p>Your letters to Mr. Blair<span class="ptr"><a name="6_308_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_308_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> and to myself, are handed to me by him. I have never doubted your courage and devotion to the cause. But you have just lost a Division, and <span class="rend-i">prima facie</span> the fault is upon you; and while that remains unchanged, for me to put you in command again, is to justly subject me to the charge of having put you there on purpose to have you lose another. If I knew facts sufficient to satisfy me that you were not in fault, or error, the case would be different. But the facts I do know, while they are not at all conclusive, and I hope they may never prove so, tend the other way.</p>
<p>First, I have scarcely seen anything from you at any time, that did not contain imputations against your superiors, and a chafing against acting the part they had assigned you. You have constantly urged the idea that you were persecuted because you did not come from West-Point, and you repeat it in these letters. This, my dear general, is I fear, the rock on which you have split.</p>
<p>In the Winchester case, you were under General Schenck, and he under Gen. Halleck. I know by Gen. Hallecks order-book, that he, on the 11th. of June advised Gen. Schenck to call you in from Winchester to Harper's Ferry; and I have been told, but do not know, that Gen. Schenck gave you the order accordingly, on the same day---and I have been told, but do not know, that on receiving it, instead of obeying it, you sent by mail a written protest against obeying it, which did not reach him until you were actually beleagered at Winchester. I say I do not know this. You hate West-Point generally, and General Halleck particularly; but I do know that it is not his fault that you were at Winchester on the 13th. 14th. and morning of the 15th.---the days of your disaster. If Gen. Schenck gave the order on the 11th. as Gen. Halleck advised, it was an easy matter for you to have been off at least on the 12th. The case is inevitably between Gen. Schenck &amp; you. Neither Gen. Halleck, nor any one else, so far as I know, required you to stay and fight 60,000, with 6,000, as you insinuate. I know Gen. Halleck, through Gen. Schenck required you to get away, &amp; that in abundant time for you to have done it. Gen. Schenck is not a West-Pointer &amp; has no prejudice against you on that score.</p>
<p>Yours very truly A. Lincoln</p>

<p>Schenck never gave me Hallocks said order. But mearly ordered me to send off (back) all surpluss stores &amp;c. but in the mean time to hold my position till further orders. I sent off all surpluss stores held my position, but got no <span class="rend-i">further orders</span> because I was surrounded &amp; telegraf wires cut.''</p>
<p>On June 28 Milroy wrote John P. Usher, from Baltimore, ``I ask you as a friend in Gods name, to go with it [enclosed letter] to the President at once, &amp; try to procure my release from the grasp of an incompetent unprincipled tyrant.'' The letter to Lincoln is in part as follows: ``I had no orders to evacuate Winchester, I was told to get ready. . . . Myself and brother officers felt sure that Hooker would occupy the whole of Lee's army, &amp; I felt entirely able for all the Rebel forces in the Valley. . . . And the salvation of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Rail road depending wholly upon our holding . . . and mistaking the advance of Lee's Army by way of Front Royal, for a feint by a few hundred cavalry . . . I held on at Winchester until I was surrounded by a force of about 60,000. . . .</p>
<p>``I love my country &amp; the Union dearer than life, and God knows that every faculty of my soul &amp; body has been devoted to its salvation. . . . I have never asked a leave of absence &amp; have not been absent from my command a single day or night . . . until two days ago, I was suspended from command and day or night . . . until two days ago, I was suspended from command and placed in arrest by order of General Halleck, like a common fellon.</p>
<p>``I may have erred in judgment in remaining too long at Winchester . . . but without disobeying any orders or being guilty of any crime, I am deprived of command &amp; made a prisoner. . . . Halleck hates me without cause . . . with the blind unreasoning hatred of an Indian &amp; I can ask or expect nothing but injustice from him, and I respectfully ask you sir, as a friend of our country, to suspend my arrest if only temporarily, during the present terrible crisis, and give me something to do, if it is only the command of a company in active service. If permitted I would freely resign my present commission, &amp; take any command, or go into the ranks as a private, rather than remain idle at this critical period.</p>
<p>``After the crisis is passed, &amp; my country is saved, Halleck may have me tried to his hearts content and hang me if he can.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>The records show that on June 11, Schenck relayed to Lieutenant Colonel Donn Piatt from Martinsburg, Halleck's instructions to withdraw to Harper's Ferry, and that Piatt's telegram relaying the order was received by Milroy at midnight on the same day. Milroy thereupon telegraphed Schenck that he had the place well protected and hated to give it up, and Schenck replied at 1 A.M. on June 12, ``Lieutenant-Colonel Piatt . . . misunderstood me, and somewhat exceeded his instructions. You will make all the required preparations for withdrawing, but hold your position in the meantime. Be ready for movement, but await further orders. . . .'' (OR, I, XXVII, II, 49-50).</p>
<p>On the night of June 12, Milroy telegraphed Schenck of the approach of the enemy and asked whether to abandon his position or not. Schenck's reply ordering Milroy to fall back to Harper's Ferry was not received because the wires had been cut by the enemy. (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>., 50-52).</p>

<p>I have just received your letter dated the 25th of June.</p>
<p>I assure you, and you may feel authorized in stating, that the recent change of commanders in the Department of the South was made for no reasons which convey any imputation upon your known energy, efficiency and patriotism; but for causes which seemed to me sufficient, while they were in no degree incompatible with the respect and esteem in which I have always held you, as a man and an officer.</p>
<p>I cannot, by giving my consent to a publication of whose details I know nothing, assume the responsibility of whatever you may write.

<p>Welles' <span class="rend-i">Diary</span> for July 4 records his reception of the telegram as follows: ``Received this evening a dispatch from Admiral Lee, stating he had a communication from A. H. Stephens, who wishes to go to Washington with a companion as military commissioner from Jefferson Davis . . . and desires permission to pass the blockade. . . . Showed the dispatch to Blair, whom I met. He made no comment. Saw Stanton directly after, who swore and growled indignantly. The President was at the Soldiers' Home and not expected for an hour or two. Consulted Seward, who was emphatic against having anything to do with Stephens or Davis. Did not see the President till late. In the mean time Stanton and others had seen him, and made known their feelings and views. The President treats the subject as not very serious nor very important, and proposes to take it up to-morrow.''</p>
<p>On July 5 Welles' <span class="rend-i">Diary</span> records the cabinet meeting at 11 A.M. as follows: ``The principal topic was the mission of Alexander H. Stephens. The President read a letter from Colonel [William H.] Ludlow . . . to Secretary Stanton, stating that Stephens had made a communication to Admiral Lee, which the Admiral had sent to the Secretary of the Navy. After reading them, the President said he was at first disposed to put this matter aside without many words, or much thought, but a night's reflection and some remarks yesterday had modified his views. While he was opposed to having Stephens and his vessel come here, he thought it would be well to send some one---perhaps go himself---to Fortress Monroe. Both Seward and Stanton were startled when this remark<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;316</span>
was made. Seward did not think it advisable the President should go, nor any one else. . . . The most he . . . would do would be to allow Stephens to forward any communication through General Dix. . . . Stanton was earnest and emphatic against having anything to do with Stephens, or Jeff Davis, or their communication. Chase was decided against having any intercourse with them. Blair took a different view. . . . I propose to take some notice of his application, and, unless the President objects, send an answer as follows to Admiral Lee:---</p>
<p>`` `The object of the communication borne by Mr. Stephens is not stated or intimated. It is not expedient from this indefinite information that you should permit that gentleman to pass the blockade. . . .' . . . The President said my letter did not dispose of the communication which Stephens bore. I told him the dispatch did not exclude it. . . .''</p>
<p>On July 2, Jefferson Davis had enclosed two copies of a communication addressed to Lincoln with the following instructions to Alexander H. Stephens:</p>
<p>``Having accepted your patriotic offer to proceed as a military commissioner under flag of truce to Washington, you will receive here with your letters of authority to the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States. This letter is signed by me as Commander-in-Chief of the Confederate land and naval forces.</p>
<p>``You will perceive from the terms of the letter that it is so worded as to avoid any political difficulties in its reception. Intended exclusively as one of those communications between belligerents which public law recognizes as necessary and proper between hostile forces, care has been taken to give no pretext for refusing to receive it on the ground that it would involve a tacit recognition of the independence of the Confederacy. . . . Your mission is simply one of humanity and has no political aspect. If objection is made to receiving your letter on the ground that it is not addressed to Abraham Lincoln as President . . . then you will present the duplicate letter, which is addressed to him as President and signed by me as President. To this latter objection may be made on the ground that I am not recognized to be President of the Confederacy. In this event you will decline any further attempt to confer on the subject of your mission, as such conference is admissible only on the footing of perfect equality. . . .'' (OR, II, VI, 74-75).</p>
<p>Davis' communication to Lincoln, abridged, is as follows:</p>
<p>``Numerous difficulties . . . have arisen in relation to the execution of the cartel of exchange . . . and the commissioners of the exchange of prisoners have been unable to adjust their differences. . . . I believe that I have just ground of complaint against the officers and forces under your command for breach of trust of the cartel, and being myself ready to execute it at all times in good faith I am not justified in doubting the existence of the same disposition on your part. In addition to this matter I have to complain of the conduct of your officers . . . in many parts of the country who violate all the rules of war by carrying on hostilities . . . against non-combatants, aged men, women and children. . . .</p>
<p>``Still again others of your officers . . . have recently taken the lives of prisoners . . . by asserting a right to treat as spies the military officers and enlisted men under my command who may penetrate into States recognized by us as our allies . . . against the United States, but claimed by the latter as having refused to engage in such warfare. . . . I have . . . refrained from the exercise of . . . retaliation because of its obvious tendency to lead to war of indiscriminate massacre on both sides. . . .</p>
<p>``With the view . . . of making one last solemn attempt to avert such calamities . . . I have selected the bearer of this letter, the Hon. Alexander H. Stephens, as a military commissioner to proceed to your headquarters under flag of truce, there to confer and agree on the subjects above mentioned. . . .''

[Washington,] July 6, 1863--- 7 p.m.</div>
<p>Major-General Halleck: I left the telegraph office a good deal dissatisfied. You know I did not like the phrase, in Orders, No. 68, I believe, ``Drive the invaders from our soil.'' Since that, I see a dispatch from General French, saying the enemy is crossing his wounded over the river in flats, without saying why he does not stop it, or even intimating a thought that it ought to be stopped. Still later, another dispatch from General Pleasonton, by direction of General Meade, to General French, stating that the main army is halted because it is believed the rebels are concentrating ``on the road toward Hagerstown, beyond Fairfield,'' and is not to move until it is ascertained that the rebels intend to evacuate Cumberland Valley.</p>
<p>These things all appear to me to be connected with a purpose to cover Baltimore and Washington, and to get the enemy across the river again without a further collision, and they do not appear connected with a purpose to prevent his crossing and to destroy him. I do fear the former purpose is acted upon and the latter is rejected.</p>
<p>If you are satisfied the latter purpose is entertained and is judiciously pursued, I am content. If you are not so satisfied, please look to it. Yours, truly, A. LINCOLN.</p>

General Alfred Pleasonton telegraphed General William H. French at 11 A.M. on July 6, ``Major-General Meade desires me to say, in consequence of a large body of the enemy being concentrated on the road toward Hagerstown, beyond Fairfield, he has suspended his operations for the present.

When you first reached the vicinity of Vicksburg, I thought you should do, what you finally did---march the troops across the neck, run the batteries with the transports, and thus go below; and I never had any faith, except a general hope that you knew better than I, that the Yazoo Pass expedition, and the like, could succeed. When you got below, and took Port- -Gibson, Grand Gulf, and vicinity, I thought you should go down the river and join Gen.

I regard this letter as official and confidential. The publication of it, with my knowledge or consent, would have been a gross breach of your confidence. . . . If obtained by the connivance of one of my subordinates . . . a like breach of trust had been committed. If a copy of the letter had been sent by you to General Curtis, and this found its way to the press without his or your authority, a serious offense had been committed by some one. In either case it was my . . . duty to ascertain who had been guilty of so great a breach of trust. . . . I then sent . . . a verbal request to Mr. McKee to call and explain. . . . Mr. McKee paid no attention. . . . After waiting several days, I caused one of my staff officers, a personal friend of Mr. McKee, to repeat the request in writing. This Mr. McKee also treated with<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;327</span></p>
<p>contempt. . . . After waiting several days longer, I ordered Mr. McKee to be arrested and brought before the provost- -marshal- -general, and required to give the desired information. Mr. McKee stated that the letter did not come to him from my office, but he was unwilling to say from whom it did come, and asked ten days' time in which to make his reply. This request was granted. Mr. McKee's arrest was merely nominal, he simply giving his verbal parole that he would report at the end of ten days. It is now sought, I presume, to get your order suspending further proceedings . . . and thus screen the guilty party. Mr. McKee declares his own innocence, saying he came by the letter honestly, but he is unwilling to inform me who the guilty party is. It seems probable from all I can learn that Mr. McKee obtained the letter . . . through some friend of General Curtis, to whom, I presume, you sent a copy of it, and not through the infidelity of some person under my command, as at first appeared. If this is true, I am very willing to stop proceedings in the matter if you will express your willingness to overlook the offense committed in the publication of the letter, or in giving it to the press for publication, and to pardon the offender without knowing who he may be. . . .''

<div class="opener">Executive Mansion,<br>
Major General Meade Washington, July 14, 1863.</div>
<p>I have just seen your despatch to Gen. Halleck, asking to be relieved of your command, because of a supposed censure of mine. I am very---<span class="rend-i">very</span>---grateful to you for the magnificient success you gave the cause of the country at Gettysburg; and I am sorry now to be the author of the slightest pain to you. But I was in such deep distress myself that I could not restrain some expression of it. I had been oppressed nearly ever since the battles at Gettysburg, by what appeared to be evidences that yourself, and Gen. Couch, and Gen. Smith,<span class="ptr"><a name="6_327_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_327_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> were not seeking a collision with the enemy, but were trying to get him across the river without another battle. What these evidences were, if you please, I hope to tell you at some time, when we shall both feel better. The case, summarily stated is this. You fought and beat the enemy at Gettysburg; and, of course, to say the least, his loss was as great as yours. He retreated; and you did not, as it seemed to me, pressingly pursue him; but a flood in the river detained him, till, by slow degrees,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;328</span>
you were again upon him. You had at least twenty thousand veteran troops directly with you, and as many more raw ones within supporting distance, all in addition to those who fought with you at Gettysburg; while it was not possible that he had received a single recruit; and yet you stood and let the flood run down, bridges be built, and the enemy move away at his leisure, without attacking him. And Couch and Smith! The latter left Carlisle in time, upon all ordinary calculation, to have aided you in the last battle at Gettysburg; but he did not arrive. At the end of more than ten days, I believe twelve, under constant urging, he reached Hagerstown from Carlisle, which is not an inch over fiftyfive miles, if so much. And Couch's movement was very little different.</p>
<p>Again, my dear general, I do not believe you appreciate the magnitude of the misfortune involved in Lee's escape. He was within your easy grasp, and to have closed upon him would, in connection with our other late successes, have ended the war. As it is, the war will be prolonged indefinitely. If you could not safely attack Lee last monday, how can you possibly do so South of the river, when you can take with you very few more than two thirds of the force you then had in hand? It would be unreasonable to expect, and I do not expect you can now effect much. Your golden opportunity is gone, and I am distressed immeasureably because of it.</p>
<p>I beg you will not consider this a prossecution, or persecution of yourself. As you had learned that I was dissatisfied, I have thought it best to kindly tell you why.</p>

Halleck telegraphed Meade at 1 P.M. on July 14, ``The enemy should be pursued and cut up, wherever he may have gone. This pursuit may or may not be upon the rear or flank, as circumstances may require. The inner flank toward Washington presents the greatest advantages. Supply yourself from the country as far as possible. I cannot advise details, as I do not know where Lee's army is, nor where your pontoon bridges are. I need hardly say to you that the escape of Lee's army without another battle has created great dissatisfaction in the mind of the President, and it will require an active and energetic pursuit on your part to remove the impression that it has not been sufficiently active heretofore.''

<p>Meade replied at 2:30 P.M., ``Having performed my duty conscientiously and to the best of my ability, the censure of the President conveyed in your dispatch of 1 p.m. this day, is, in my judgment, so undeserved that I feel compelled most respectfully to ask to be immediately relieved from the command of this army.''

<p>``On receipt of this letter I lost no time in laying it before the President of the United States, who expressed great gratification at hearing such sentiments from you, one of the most influential and honored of the Southern governors, and he desires me to say that he fully shares your anxiety for the restoration of<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;331</span>
peace between the States, and for a reunion of all the States on the basis of the abolition of slavery,---the bone we are fighting over,---and the full reinstatement of every Confederate citizen in all the rights of citizenship in our common country. These points conceded, the President authorizes me to say that he will be glad to receive overtures from any man, or body of men, who have authority to control the armies of the Confederacy; and that he and the United States Congress will be found very liberal on all collateral points that may come up in the settlement.</p>
<p>``His views on the collateral points that may naturally arise, the President desires me to say he will communicate to you through me if you should suggest the personal interview that Mr. Edward Kidder recommends in his letter to his brother. In that case you will please forward to me, through Mr. Kidder, your official permit, as Governor of North Carolina, to enter and leave the State, and to remain in it in safety during the pendency of these negotiations, which, I suppose, should be conducted in entire secrecy until they assume an official character.

<div class="opener">July 15, 1863</div>
<p>By the President of the United States of America.</p>
<p>A Proclamation.</p>
<p>It has pleased Almighty God to hearken to the supplications and prayers of an afflicted people, and to vouchsafe to the army and the navy of the United States victories on land and on the sea so signal and so effective as to furnish reasonable grounds for augmented confidence that the Union of these States will be maintained, their constitution preserved, and their peace and prosperity permanently restored. But these victories have been accorded not without sacrifices of life, limb, health and liberty incurred by brave, loyal and patriotic citizens. Domestic affliction in every part of the country follows in the train of these fearful bereavements. It is meet and right to recognize and confess the presence of the Almighty Father and the power of His Hand equally in these triumphs and in these sorrows:</p>
<p>Now, therefore, be it known that I do set apart Thursday the 6th. day of August next, to be observed as a day for National Thanksgiving, Praise and Prayer, and I invite the People of the United States to assemble on that occasion in their customary places of worship, and in the forms approved by their own consciences, render the homage due to the Divine Majesty, for the wonderful things he has done in the Nation's behalf, and invoke the influence of His Holy Spirit to subdue the anger, which has produced, and so long sustained a needless and cruel rebellion, to change the hearts of the insurgents, to guide the counsels of the Government with wisdom adequate to so great a national emergency, and to visit with tender care and consolation throughout the length and breadth of our land all those who, through the vicissitudes of marches, voyages, battles and sieges, have been brought to suffer in mind, body or estate, and finally to lead the whole nation, through the paths of repentance and submission to the Divine Will, back to the perfect enjoyment of Union and fraternal peace.</p>
<p>In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;333</span>[L.S.]</p>
<p>Done at the city of Washington, this fifteenth day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the eighty-eighth.</p>

<p>``The order for a military occupation of New Almaden was surreptitiously obtained. The Secretary of War has directed General Wright to suspend operations, to restore everything as he found it, and to obey no orders which do not come through the proper channels.'' (OR, I, L, II, 522).</p>
<p>On July 14, Swett sent Lincoln three telegrams as follows:</p>
<p>``Abraham Lincoln, President United States:</p>
<p>``After full consultation with owner and attorney at mine, it was determined no actual resistance should be offered. In a short time I would have had peaceable possession, but when your dispatch came the marshal was telegraphed that you had ordered to wait. Your order can yet be executed. If you determine to do it, telegraph me giving discretion, and I will be responsible for consequences. If you do not think best to execute the order let the Attorney-General authorize me by telegraph to obtain an injunction and receiver. In my opinion the injunction had better be applied for. The Government owes it to its own dignity to do one of these things. I have offered the company the same terms proposed by the Quicksilver Company, and they positively refuse to do anything. LEONARD SWETT. (Sent to Secretary of Interior.)'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>., p. 523).</p>
<p>``To Abraham Lincoln President US For Secretary of Interior---</p>
<p>``The Almaden Company realize more than a million of dollars annually. They have no recognized miners claim, for a miners claim is a certain number of feet allowed by local law---contrary to mining laws, they claim a large tract of land. If Government had not yielded there would have been acquiescence, but having yielded one step the Almaden Company are striving by every conceivable means to make Government abandon property. Their position now is that the mine is government land and because of that fact the Govt should do nothing either by the order or the courts. If this deliberate attempt to drive the Government from its rights succeeds, it will be quoted as a precedent in future and will breed great mischief. The mandate of the Supreme Court should be sent here, and the Govt by an injunction ought to save the fund arising<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;334</span>
from the Mine, until the termination of the suit, when Congress may dispose of it as it pleases. LEONARD SWETT.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>

He also tells me, that 8000 will be about the quota of New-Jersey on the first draft; and the Sec. of War says the first draft in that State would not be made for some time in any event. As every man obtained otherwise lessens the draft so much, and this may supersede it altogether, I hope you will push forward your volunteer regiments as fast as possible. It is a very delicate matter to postpone the draft in one State, because of the argument it furnishes others to have postponements also. If we could have a <span class="rend-i">reason</span> in, one case, which would be good if presented, in all cases, we could act upon it.</p>
<p>I will thank you therefore to inform me if you can, by what day, at the earliest, you can promise to have ready to be mustered into the U.S. service, the 8000, men. If you can make a reliable promise (I mean one which you can rely on yourself) of this sort, it will be of great value, if the day is not too remote.</p>
<p>I beg you to be assured I wish to avoid the difficulties you dread, as much as yourself. Your Obt. Servt. A LINCOLN</p>

<p>Yours dated Pittsburgh, the 19 Inst. is received. The day after you were with me I wrote a note to the Sec. of War, asking him to place you on the same ground, with all other governors of loyal States as to the appointment of military officers. In reply to this he verbally told me, when I next met him, that he had never placed you on any other ground---that the forces in regard to which you and Gen. Blunt have a controversy, were raised on special authority from the War Department, given before you were governor, and that the officers were commissioned by him (the Sec. of War) according to the original authority; and that he never had required you to commission officers nominated by Gen. Blunt. The like of this has been done in some other States, as I remember. As to leaving no part of Kansas in Blunt's Department, the thing should not be hastily done. He, with his command, is now in the field South of Kansas; and while I do not know how much what you now desire, might interfere with his supplies, it is very certain that he can not now be interfering with you.</p>

My dear General Howard Washington, July 21. 1863.</div>
<p>Your letter of the 18th. is received. I was deeply mortified by the escape of Lee across the Potomac, because the substantial destruction of his army would have ended the war, and because I believed, such destruction was perfectly easy---believed that Gen. Meade and his noble army had expended all the skill, and toil, and blood, up to the ripe harvest, and then let the crop go to waste. Perhaps my mortification was heightened because I had always believed---making my belief a hobby possibly---that the main rebel army going North of the Potomac, could never return, if well attended to; and because I was so greatly flattered in this belief, by the operations at Gettysburg. A few days having passed, I am now profoundly grateful for what was done, without criticism for what was not done. Gen. Meade has my confidence as a brave and skillful officer, and a true man. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADfS, DLC-RTL. General Howard's letter of July 18, marked ``Unofficial'' by Howard, reads:</p>
<p>``Having noticed in the newspapers certain statements bearing upon the battles [<span class="rend-i">sic</span>] of Gettysburg and subsequent operations which I deem calculated to convey a wrong impression to your mind, I wish to submit a few statements. The successful issue of the battle of Gettysburg was due mainly to the energetic operations of our present commanding General prior to the engagement and to the manner in which he handled his troops on the field. The reserves have never before during the war been thrown in at just the right moment. . . . Moreover I have never seen a more hearty co-operation on the part of General officers as since General Meade took the command.</p>
<p>``As to not attacking the enemy prior to leaving his stronghold beyond the Antietam it is by no means certain that the repulse of Gettysburg might not have been turned upon us; at any rate the Commanding General was in favor of an immediate attack but with the evident difficulties in our way the uncertainty of a success and the strong conviction of our best military minds against the risk, I must say, that I think the General acted wisely.</p>
<p>``As to my request to make a reconnaissance on the morning of the 14th which the papers state was refused; the facts are, that the General had required me to reconnoitre the evening before and give my opinion as to the practicability of making a lodgement on the enemy's left, and his answer to my subsequent request was, that the movements he had already ordered would subserve the same purpose.</p>
<p>``We have, if I may be allowed to say it, a Commanding General in whom all the officers, with whom I have come in contact, express complete confidence. I have said this much because of the censure and of the misrepresentations which have grown out of the escape of Lee's army.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>Howard doubtless referred to a Washington dispatch of July 17, entitled ``The Escape of Lee's Army,'' appearing in the New York <span class="rend-i">Tribune</span> of July 18, stating: ``The President sent two dispatches to Gen. Meade a day or two before the escape of the enemy across the river, in both of which he urged the necessity of an immediate attack. In one of these dispatches he said he thought all the appearances indicated that no other occasion would speedily arise offering circumstances<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;342</span>
so favorable to us and so unfavorable to the enemy. He therefore wished a battle to be delivered at once. In the council of war which decided against attacking Gen. Lee, at a time when subsequent disclosures have shown only two-thirds of his army, perhaps forty thousand men would have been in line to receive our soldiers flushed with victory, the other third having already crossed, the Generals who pronounced against the attack were [John] Sedgwick, [George] Sykes, [William H.] French, [Alexander] Hays and [Henry W.] Slocum. Those in favor of attack were Generals Meade, Howard, Pleasonton, and [James S.] Wadsworth, temporarily commanding the First Corps, (Gen. John Newton being sick), with Generals [Andrew A.] Humphreys and [Gouverneur K.] Warren, of Gen. Meade's staff. The last named made a powerful speech, in which he showed the necessity of immediate movement. Gen. Wadsworth also, adding his voice to his vote, insisted with all his might that there was the occasion to destroy Lee's army.''</p>

When my views of the policy necessary to the restoration of peace and civil government have been disregarded, I have caused the facts to be made known to you in order that you might apply the remedy. . . . If making to you the proper representation of facts constituted me the head of a faction then I have been such; but if I was performing a simple duty to you, upon whom rests the ultimate responsibility for the government of the military, then my conduct was necessary for the country, and just to you, and furnished no ground for your attack upon me. . . .</p>
<p>``Mr President, I have disapproved of acts of your administration, but I have carefully abstained from denouncing you . . . and this because there is nothing of a `factional' spirit in me. . . .</p>
<p>``You can then judge sir how grossly offensive the language of your letter is, when you say `as' (that is, <span class="rend-i">because</span>) `I could not remove Gov Gamble I had to remove General Curtis' distinctly intimating that you would have removed me if you could. . . .</p>
<p>``Occupying the position which I reluctantly accepted at the call of my State . . . I am obliged to say to you that your insult published over the land was most undeserved, and in our relations most unbecoming your station.</p>

<div class="opener">His Excellency Executive Mansion,<br>
Gov. Joel Parker, Washington, July 25. 1863.</div>
<p>Sir. Yours of the 21st. is received; and I have taken time, and considered and discussed the subject with the Secretary of War, and Provost-Marshall General, in order, if possible, to make you a more favorable answer than I finally find myself able to do. It is a vital point with us to not have a special stipulation with the Governor of any one State, because it would breed trouble in many, if not all other states; and my idea was, when I wrote you, as it still is, to get a point of time, to which we could wait, on the reason that we were not ready ourselves to proceed, and which might enable you to raise the quota of your state, in whole, or in large part, without the draft. The points of time you fix, are much further off than I had hoped. We might have got along in the way I have indicated for twenty, or possibly thirty days. As it stands, the best I can say is, that every volunteer you will present us within thirty days from this date, fit and ready to be mustered into the United States service, on the usual terms, shall be, pro-tanto - - an abatement of your quota of the draft. That quota I can now state at eight thousand, seven hundred and eighty three, (8783). No draft from New Jersey, other than for the above quota, will be made before an additional draft, common to the States, shall be required; and I may add, that if we get well through with this draft, I entertain a<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;348</span>
strong hope that any further one may never be needed. This expression of hope, however, must not be construed into a promise.</p>
<p>As to conducting the draft by Townships. I find it would require such a waste of labor already done, and such an additional amount of it, and such a loss of time, as to make it, I fear, inadmissible. Your Obt. Servt. A. LINCOLN</p>
<p>(Copy.)</p>
<p>P.S. Since writing the above getting additional information, I am enabled to say that the draft may be made in sub-districts, as the enrollment has been made, or is in process of making. This will amount practically to drafting by townships as the enrollment subdistricts, are generally about the extent of townships</p>

<p>``I feel quite confident that I can raise the 8000 men in sixty days, and I entertain little or no doubt that the men can be had in 90 days at the furthest.</p>
<p>``You speak . . . of New Jersey being behind 12000 men irrespective of those now ordered. . . . I can only say that New Jersey has sent in her own regiments more than the state has been required or authorized by the General Government to send. My only reason, however for alluding to this matter now is that I may be assured that if the 8000 men are raised in the time fixed upon, there will be no draft; that is, of course, none until a new call is made. No draft for the 12000.</p>
<p>``It would aid me very much . . . if I could assure the several Townships of the state that if any Township raised its quota, no draft would be made from such township. . . .

<div class="opener">Hon. Secretary of the Navy: Executive Mansion, Washington,<br>
Sir: July 25, 1863.</div>
<p>Certain matters have come to my notice, and considered by me, which induce me to believe, that it will conduce to the public interest for you to add to the general instructions given to our Naval Commanders, in relation to contraband trade, propositions substantially as follows, to wit:</p>
<p>``1st. You will avoid the reality, and as far as possible, the appearance,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;349</span>
of using any neutral port, to watch neutral vessels, and then to dart out and seize them on their departure.</p>
<p>``Note---Complaint is made that this has been practiced at the Port of St. Thomas, which practice, if it exist, is disapproved, and must cease.</p>
<p>``2nd. You will not, in any case, detain the crew of a captured neutral vessel, or any other subject, of a neutral power on board such vessel, as prisoners of war, or otherwise, except the small number necessary as witnesses in the prize court.</p>
<p>``Note---The practice here forbidden is also charged to exist, which, if true, is disapproved, and must cease.''</p>
<p>My dear Sir, it is not intended to be insinuated that you have been remiss in the performance of the arduous and responsible duties of your Department, which I take pleasure in affirming has, in your hands, been conducted with admirable success. Yet while your subordinates are, almost of necessity, brought into angry collision with the subjects of foreign States, the representatives of those States and yourself do not come into immediate contact, for the purpose of keeping the peace, in spite of such collisions. At that point there is an ultimate, and heavy responsibility upon me.</p>
<p>What I propose is in strict accordance with international law, and is therefore unobjectionable; while if it do no other good, it will contribute to sustain a considerable portion of the present British Ministry in their places, who, if displaced, are sure to be replaced by others more unfavorable to us.

<p>``August 12, Wednesday. The President addressed me a letter, directing additional instructions and of a more explicit character to our naval officers in relation to their conduct at neutral ports. In doing this, the President takes occasion to compliment the administration of the Navy in terms most commendatory and gratifying.</p>
<p>``The proposed instructions are in language almost identical with certain letters which have passed between Mr. Seward and Lord Lyons, which the former submitted to me and requested me to adopt. My answer was not what the Secretary and Minister had agreed between themselves should be my policy and action. The President has therefore been privately interviewed and persuaded to write me,---an unusual course with him and which he was evidently reluctant to do. He earnestly desires to keep on terms of peace with England and, as he says to me in his letter, to sustain the present Ministry, which the Secretary of State assures him is a difficult matter, requiring all his dexterity and ability,---hence constant derogatory concessions.</p>
<p>``In all of this Mr. Seward's subservient policy, or want of a policy, is perceptible. He has no convictions, no fixed principles, no rule of action, but is governed and moved by impulse, fancied expediency, and temporary circumstances. We injure neither ourselves nor Great Britain by an honest and firm maintenance of our rights, but Mr. Seward is in constant trepidation lest the</p>

<p>Seeing Gen. Meade's despatch of yesterday to yourself, causes, me to fear that he supposes the government here is demanding of him to bring on a general engagement with Lee as soon as possible. I am claiming no such thing of him. In fact, my judgment is against it; which judgment, of course, I will yield if yours and his are the contrary. If he could not safely engage Lee at Williamsport, it seems absurd to suppose he can safely engage him now, when he has scarcely more than two thirds of the force he had at Williamsport, while it must be, that Lee has been re-inforced. True, I desired Gen. Meade to pursue Lee across the Potomac, hoping, as has proved true, that he would thereby clear the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and get some advantages by harrassing him on his retreat. These being past, I am unwilling he should now get into a general engagement on the impression that we here are pressing him; and I shall be glad for you to so inform him, unless your own judgment is against it. Yours truly A. LINCOLN.</p>

The law of nations and the usages and customs of war as carried on by civilized powers, permit no distinction as to color in the treatment of prisoners of war as public enemies.

<p>The government of the United States will give the same protection to all its soldiers, and if the enemy shall sell or enslave anyone because of his color, the offense shall be punished by retaliation upon the enemy's prisoners in our possession.</p>
<p>It is therefore ordered that for every soldier of the United States killed in violation of the laws of war, a rebel soldier shall be executed; and for every one enslaved by the enemy or sold into slavery, a rebel soldier shall be placed at hard labor on the public works and continued at such labor until the other shall be released and receive the treatment due to a prisoner of war</p>

Of course the Senate, and not I, would decide whether to admit or reject him. Still I should feel great interest in the question. It may be so presented as to be one of the very greatest national importance; and it may be otherwise so presented, as to be of no more than temporary personal consequence to him.</p>
<p>The emancipation proclamation applies to Arkansas. I think it is valid in law, and will be so held by the courts. I think I shall not retract or repudiate it. Those who shall have tasted actual freedom I believe can never be slaves, or quasi slaves again. For the rest, I believe some plan, substantially being gradual emancipation, would be better for both white and black. The Missouri plan, recently adopted, I do not object to on account of the time for <span class="rend-i">ending</span> the institution; but I am sorry the <span class="rend-i">beginning</span> should have been postponed for seven years, leaving all that time to agitate for the repeal of the whole thing. It should begin at once, giving at least the new-born, a vested interest in freedom, which could not be taken away. If Senator Sebastian could come with something of this sort from Arkansas, I at least should take great interest in his case; and I believe a single individual will have scarcely done the world so great a service.

It is unnecessary for me to state however, that when differences of opinion arise between officers of the Government, the ranking officer must be obeyed. You of course recognize as clearly as I do the importance of this rule. I hope you will conclude to go on in your present position under the regulations of the Department. I wish you would write to me. I am very truly your friend and Obt Servt</p>

<p>Recent events in Mexico, I think, render early action in Texas more important than ever.

<p>Governor Boutwell read me to-day that part of your letter to him, which relates to Louisiana affairs. While I very well know<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;365</span>
what I would be glad for Louisiana to do, it is quite a different thing for me to assume direction of the matter. I would be glad for her to make a new Constitution recognizing the emancipation proclamation, and adopting emancipation in those parts of the state to which the proclamation does not apply. And while she is at it, I think it would not be objectionable for her to adopt some practical system by which the two races could gradually live themselves out of their old relation to each other, and both come out better prepared for the new. Education for young blacks should be included in the plan. After all, the power, or element, of ``contract'' may be sufficient for this probationary period; and, by it's simplicity, and flexibility, may be the better.</p>
<p>As an anti-slavery man I have a motive to desire emancipation, which pro-slavery men do not have; but even they have strong enough reason to thus place themselves again under the shield of the Union; and to thus perpetually hedge against the recurrence of the scenes through which we are now passing.</p>
<p>Gov. Shepley has informed me that Mr. Durant is now taking a registry, with a view to the election of a Constitutional convention in Louisiana. This, to me, appears proper. If such convention were to ask my views, I could present little else than what I now say to you. I think the thing should be pushed forward, so that if possible, it's mature work may reach here by the meeting of Congress.</p>
<p>For my own part I think I shall not, in any event, retract the emancipation proclamation; nor, as executive, ever return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation, or by any of the acts of Congress.</p>
<p>If Louisiana shall send members to Congress, their admission to seats will depend, as you know, upon the respective Houses, and not upon the President.</p>
<p>If these views can be of any advantage in giving shape, and impetus, to action there, I shall be glad for you to use them prudently for that object. Of course you will confer with intelligent and trusty citizens of the State, among whom I would suggest Messrs. Flanders, Hahn, and Durant; and to each of whom I now think I may send copies of this letter. Still it is perhaps better to not make the letter generally public. Yours very truly</p>

<div class="opener">Commissioner of Agriculture Executive Mansion,<br>
Sir: Washington, Aug. 5, 1863.</div>
<p>About a year ago Capt. Isaac R. Diller came to me with a proposition in regard to a new compound of gunpowder, the ingredients and mode of compounding, being a secret. It promised important advantages, which would be very valuable, if the promise were made good. But he did not wish to give the government the secret; nor did the government wish to buy it, without a test of it's value. For this object, the manufacture of a quantity of it became indispensable; and this again required the service of a good Chemist. Dr. Charles M. Wetherill, Chemist in your Department, was an acquaintance of Capt. Diller, and was sought by him to aid in the manufacturing of the powder. As I remember I requested you to allow him to do so, which you did. A small quantity was manufactured, and proved so far satisfactory that Capt. now, Admiral Dahlgren advised the making a larger quantity so as to test it for artillery use. I consented, and procured the Secretary of War and Secretary of the Navy, to advance, from time [to time], sums amounting in the whole to five thousand dollars, from funds under their discretionary control. Dr. Wetherill's service was again required, and again obtained, perhaps, so far as you are concerned, at my request. At the time, nothing was said, or thought of, so far as I remember, as to his receiving his salary at your Department, while engaged at the powder. Now, being brought to my mind, it seems reasonable he should receive his salary for that time, which he tells is refused. The manufacturer of the powder has required the building a good deal of expensive machinery, leaving the five thousand dollar fund no reliance for Dr. Wetherell. In fact, I suppose Capt. Diller thought the government was furnishing Dr. Wetherell, as one of it's officers, to make the experiment.</p>
<p>Dr. Wetherell presents another question, which is as to the amount of his permanent or general Salary. I see that the law fixes the salaries of a class to which the chemist belongs ``corresponding to the salaries of similar officers in other Departments'' and I do not see that the law assigns me any duty or discretion about it. All I can do is to give a sort of legal opinion, that his salary should be fixed according to the law. I do wish these questions<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;368</span>
could be settled, without further difficulty. I do not know what has been fixed as the salary of similar officers in other Departments; but I suppose this can not be hard to ascertain. Yours truly</p>

<div class="textindentlevelx">
<div class="opener">His Excellency Horatio Seymour Executive Mansion,<br>
Governor of New-York Washington, August 7, 1863.</div>
<p>Your communication of the 3rd. Inst. has been received, and attentively considered.</p>
<p>I can not consent to suspend the draft in New-York, as you request, because, among other reasons, <span class="rend-i">time</span> is too important.</p>
<p>By the figures you send, which I presume are correct, the twelve Districts represented fall into two classes of eight, and four respectively. The disparity of the quotas for the draft, in these two classes is certainly very striking, being the difference between an average of 2200 in one class, and 4864 in the other. Assuming that the Districts are equal, one to another, in entire population, as required by the plan on which they were made, this disparity is such as to require attention. Much of it, however, I suppose will be accounted for by the fact that so many more persons fit for soldiers, are in the city than are in the country, who have too recently arrived from other parts of the United States and from Europe to be either included in the Census of 1860, or to have voted in 1862. Still, making due allowance for this, I am yet unwilling to stand upon it as an entirely sufficient explanation of the great disparity.</p>
<p>I shall direct the draft to proceed in all the Districts, drawing however, at first, from each of the four Districts, towit: the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth, only 2200, being the average quota of the other class. After this drawing, these four Districts, and also the seventeenth and twentyninth, shall be carefully re-enrolled,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;370</span>
and, if you please, agents of yours may witness every step of the process. Any deficiency which may appear by the new enrollment will be supplied by a special draft for that object, allowing due credit for volunteers who may be obtained from these Districts respectively, during the interval. And at all points, so far as consistent, with practical convenience, due credits will be given for volunteers; and your Excellency shall be notified of the time fixed for commencing a draft in each District.</p>
<p>I do not object to abide a decision of the United States Supreme Court, or of the judges thereof, on the constitutionality of the draft law. In fact, I should be willing to facilitate the obtaining of it; but I can not consent to lose the <span class="rend-i">time</span> while it is being obtained. We are contending with an enemy who, as I understand, drives every able bodied man he can reach, into his ranks, very much as a butcher drives bullocks into a slaughter-pen. No time is wasted, no argument is used. This produces an army which will soon turn upon our now victorious soldiers already in the field, if they shall not be sustained by recruits, as they should be. It produces an army with a rapidity not to be matched on our side, if we first waste time to re-experiment with the volunteer system, already deemed by congress, and palpably, in fact, so far exhausted, as to be inadequate; and then more time, to obtain a court decision, as to whether a law is constitutional, which requires a part of those not now in the service, to go to the aid of those who are already in it; and still more time, to determine with absolute certainty, that we get those, who are to go, in the precisely legal proportion, to those who are not to go.</p>
<p>My purpose is to be, in my action, just and constitutional; and yet practical, in performing the important duty, with which I am charged, of maintaining the unity, and the free principles of our common country. Your Obt. Servt. A. LINCOLN.</p>

Your cards and notes had come to me on two or three successive days before; and I knew then, as well as I do now, after reading the petition, what your mission was. I knew it was the same true, and painful story, which Gov. Johnson, Mr. Maynard, Dr. Clements and other have been telling me for more than two years. I also knew that meeting you could do no good; because I have all the while done, and shall continue to do the best for you I could, and can. I do as much for East Tennessee as I would, or could, if my own home, and family were in Knoxville. The difficulties of getting a Union army into that region, and of keeping it there, are so apparant,---so obvious---that none can fail to see them, unless it may be those who are driven mad and blind by their sufferings. Start by whatever route they may, their lines of supply are broken before they get half way. A small force, sufficient to beat the enemy now there, would be of no value, because the enemy would re-inforce to meet them, until we should have to give back, or accumulate so large a force, as to be very difficult to supply, and as to ruin us entirely if a great disaster should befal it. I know you are too much distressed to be argued with; and therefore I do not attempt it at length. You know I am not indifferent to your troubles; else I should not, more than a year and a half ago, have made the effort I did to have a Railroad built on purpose to relieve you. The Secretary of War, Gen. Halleck, Gen. Burnside, and Gen. Rosecrans are all engaged now in an effort to relieve your section.

I have no reason to doubt that you are doing what you reasonably can upon the same subject. I believe it is a resource which, if vigorously applied now, will soon close the contest. It works doubly, weakening the enemy and strengthening us. We were not fully ripe for it until the river was opened. Now, I think at least a hundred thousand can, and ought to be rapidly organized along it's shores, relieving all the white troops to serve elsewhere.</p>

<p>``After the fall of Vicksburg I did incline very much to an immediate move on Mobile. I believed then the place could be taken with but little effort, and . . . we would have . . . a base to opperate from . . . as would make them<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;375</span>
abandon entirely the states bound . . . by the Miss. I see however the importance of a movement into Texas just at this time.</p>
<p>``I have reinforced Gen. Banks with the 13th Army Corps . . . .</p>
<p>``I have given the subject of arming the negro my hearty support. This, with the emancipation . . . is the heavyest blow yet given the Confederacy . . . .</p>

<div class="opener">Executive Mansion,<br>
My Dear General Rosecrans Washington, August 10, 1863.</div>
<p>Yours of the 1st was received two days ago. I think you must have inferred more than Gen Halleck has intended, as to any dissatisfaction of mine with you. I am sure you, as a reasonable man, would not have been wounded, could you have heard all my words and seen all my thoughts, in regard to you. I have not abated in my kind feeling for and confidence in you. I have seen most of your despatches to General Halleck---probably all of them. After Grant invested Vicksburg, I was very anxious lest Johnston should overwhelm him from the outside, and when it appeared certain that part of Bragg's force had gone, and was going to Johnston, it did seem to me, it was the exactly proper time for you to attack Bragg with what force he had left. In all kindness, let me say, it so seems to me yet. Finding from your despatches to General Halleck that your judgement was different, and being very anxious for Grant, I, on one occasion told Gen. Halleck, I thought he should direct you to decide at once, to immediately attack Bragg or to stand on the defensive, and send part of your force to Grant. He replied he had already so directed, in substance. Soon after, despatches from Grant abated my anxiety for him, and in proportion abated my anxiety about any movement of yours. When afterwards, however, I saw a despatch of yours arguing that the right time for you to attack Bragg was not before but would be after the fall of Vicksburg, it impressed me very strangely; and I think I so stated to the Secretary of War and General Halleck. It seemed no other than the proposition that you could better fight Bragg <span class="rend-i">when</span> Johnston should be at liberty to return and assist him, than you could <span class="rend-i">before</span> he could so return to his assistance.</p>
<p>Since Grant has been entirely relieved by the fall of Vicksburg, by which Johnston is also relieved, it has seemed to me that your chance for a stroke, has been considerably diminished, and I have not been pressing you directly or indirectly. True, I am very anxious for East Tennessee to be occupied by us; but I see and appreciate the difficulties you mention. The question occurs, Can the thing be done at all? Does preparation advance at all? Do you not consume supplies as fast as you get them forward? Have you more animals today than you had at the battle of Stone River? and yet have not more been furnished you since then than your entire present stock? I ask the same questions as to your mounted force.</p>
<p>Do not misunderstand. I am not casting blame upon you. I<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;378</span>
rather think, by great exertion, you can get to East Tennessee. But a very important question is, ``Can you stay there?'' I make no order in the case---that I leave to General Halleck and yourself.</p>
<p>And now, be assured once more, that I think of you in all kindness and confidence: and that I am not watching you with an evileye. Yours very truly</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; AES, RDB.Lincoln's endorsement has been removed from the attendant document. It seems probable that Lincoln's letter to Welles, July 25, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>, was not delivered until shortly before August 12, as indicated by the entry<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;379</span></p>
<p>in Welles' <span class="rend-i">Diary</span> under that date. If so, it may be inferred that Lincoln on August 10 transmitted to Seward the substance of his instructions to Welles, to be incorporated in a reply to Lord Lyons. Secretary Welles pursued the matter further in a letter to Lincoln dated September 30, 1863:</p>
<p>``Since the interview with you some weeks since in relation to certain proposed instructions to our Naval Officers, I have, as suggested, given the subject careful and thorough investigation, and am fully satisfied that neither in British law nor British practice is there any authority or precedent for such instructions. As Her Majesty's representative has introduced the subject, I have embodied what I believe to be the law and usage on the several points, in a distinct paper, which can, if you think proper, be submitted to Lord Lyons, and, if I have in that document done injustice, in any respect, to British authority and British usage, or misapprehended or misstated international law, I shall be happy to be corrected.</p>
<p>``Permit me in this connection to express my surprise and regret that the British Minister should so persistently insist on interfering in matters that belong to the Prize Courts, and on which he should not be heard from diplomatically, as were Great Britain in our case and we in hers, the American Minister in London would not be heard diplomatically, until judicial remedies have been exhausted. His right to be heard in the Court of Prize, according to its rules of procedure, and in the proper cases, is unquestioned. If the Court, after its appellate jurisdiction is fully exhausted, should fail to do justice in any case, then undoubtedly, and not till then, diplomacy may properly come in. But I do not understand by what authority Her Majesty's Minister intervenes at all, even in the Prize Courts by suggestion, or before you, in cases where the violation of territorial immunities of neutral powers, other than Great Britain is in question. If our Naval Offi[c]ers violate the Sovereignty, or the neutrality, or the municipal regulations of a neutral State, we are, first in our prize courts, and then diplomatically, amenable for that violation to the Neutral State itself, and not to Great Britain, even though the act of violation has been perpetrated there by us upon a British vessel. There is no principal of international law better settled than this, and I respectfully insist that no one but the Sovereign of the neutral territory which is violated, has the slightest right to allege, or suggest such violation even in our prize courts and much less diplomatically.</p>
<p>``As regards persons on board of captured neutral vessels, the best rule of law is that they shall be sent in as witnesses; the requirement of law is that some be sent in; and if the Captor fails to send them all in, he so fails at his peril of not sending enough; and if he sends them all in, all being neutral, no one has the right any where to complain of him, provided only that he had probable cause for capturing the ship. But in the war in which we are now engaged, it must be remembered that no inconsiderable portion of the persons captured on some of the vessels claiming to be neutral, are rebels. It is impossible for the captor to decide, who or how many, are rebels. It certainly is not advisable to go counter to the rule so framed by all the courts nor to release captured rebel prisoners.</p>
<p>``I am not unaware of your strong desire to conciliate Great Britain and to make all reasonable concessions to preserve friendly relations with her. In this feeling I cordially participate. But my earnest conviction is that we shall best command the respect, which insures peace, by firmly but not offensively maintaining our rights; and in no way can amicable relations with Great Britain, and all others, be so surely maintained as by our claiming only what is right, by surrendering nothing that is clearly and indispensably our own, and by referring always the question of what our just rights are to those tribunals of Prize, which are instituted by the consent of nations to adjudge these points under the law of nations and in the interests of peace, by reason of the acknowledged inability of diplomacy, even in the most skilful hands, to deal<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;380</span>
satisfactorily before hand with these complicated questions as they arise.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>

<p>``There are no formal charges against Major Genl McClernand. Genl Grant has reported his reasons for removing him from command.''</p>
<p>John A. McClernand wrote Lincoln on August 3:</p>
<p>``According to news-paper account it is the purpose of my enemy's, at this late day, to attempt to gloss [?] the more than mortal injury they have done me, by bringing me before a court martial. If so; let me, as an American . . . more jealous of my honor than of my life, appeal to you to see that I am fairly dealt by---that I am not held up before the country for months in the character of an alleged culprit, as an excuse for withholding from me a command . . . .''

McClernand failed to submit the order to Grant before issuing it to the press, as was required by regulations. On June 18 Grant removed McClernand, and on June 26 transmitted the papers in the case to Lorenzo Thomas with the comment: ``A disposition and earnest desire on my part to do the most I could with the means at my command, without interference with the assignments to command which the President alone was authorized to make, made me tolerate General McClernand long after I thought the good of the service demanded his removal. It was only when almost the entire army under my command seemed to demand it that he was relieved . . . .'' (OR, I, XXIV, I,158-59).

<p>Yours of the 8th. with Judge Advocate General Waterbury's report, was received to-day. Asking you to remember that I consider <span class="rend-i">time</span> as being very important, both to the general cause of the country, and to the soldiers already in the field, I beg to remind you that I waited, at your request, from the 1st till the 6th. Inst. to receive your communication dated the 3rd. In view of it's great length, and the known time, and apparant care, taken in it's preparation, I did not doubt that it contained your full case as you desired to present it. It contained figures for twelve Districts, omitting the other nineteen, as I supposed, because you found nothing to complain of, as to them. I answered accordingly. In doing so, I laid down the principle to which I purpose adhering---which is, to proceed with the draft, at the same time employing infallible means to avoid any great wrongs. With the communication received to-day, you send figures for twenty eight Districts, including<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;382</span>
the twelve sent before, and still omitting three, from which I suppose the enrolments are not yet received. In looking over this fuller list of twenty eight Districts, I find that the quotas for sixteen of them are above 2000 and below 2700, while, of the rest, six are above 2700 and six are below 2000. Applying the principle to these new facts, the 5th. and 7th. Districts must be added to the four in which the quotas have already been reduced to 2200 for the first draft; and, with these, four others must be added to those to be re-enrolled.</p>
<p>The corrected case will then stand:</p>
<p>The quotas of the 2nd. 4th. 5th. 6th. 7th. &amp; 8th. Districts fixed at 2200. for the first draft.</p>
<p>The Provost-Marshal-General informs me that the drawing is already completed in 16th. 17th. 18th. 22nd. 24th. 26th. 27th. 28th. 29th. &amp; 30th. Districts.</p>
<p>In the others, except the three outstanding, the drawing will be made upon the quotas as now fixed.</p>
<p>After the first draft, the 2nd. 4th. 5th. 6th. 7th. 8th. 16th. 17th. 21st. 25th. 29th &amp; 31st.

<div class="opener">Major General McClernand: Executive Mansion,<br>
My dear Sir: Washington, August 12, 1863.</div>
<p>Our friend, William G. Greene, has just presented a kind letter in regard to yourself, addressed to me by our other friends, Yates, Hatch, and Dubois. I doubt whether your present position is more painful to you than to myself. Grateful for the patriotic stand so early taken by you in this life-and-death struggle of the nation, I have done whatever has appeared practicable to advance you and the public interest together. No charges, with a view to a trial, have been preferred against you by any one; nor do I suppose any will be. All there is, so far as I have heard, is Gen. Grant's statement of his reasons for relieving you. And even this I have not seen or sought to see; because it is a case, as appears to me, in which I could do nothing without doing harm. Gen. Grant and yourself have been conspicuous in our most important successes; and for me to interfere, and thus magnify a breach between you, could not but be of evil effect. Better leave it where the law of the case has placed it. For me to force you back upon Gen. Grant, would be forcing him to resign. I can not give you a new command, because we have no forces except such as already have commanders. I am constantly pressed by those who <span class="rend-i">scold</span> before they <span class="rend-i">think</span>, or without thinking at all, to give commands respectively to Fremont, McClellan, Butler, Sigel, Curtis, Hunter, Hooker, and perhaps others; when, all else out of the way, I have no commands to give them. This is now your case, which, as I have before said, pains me, not less than it does you.</p>
<p>My belief is that the permanent estimate of what a general does in the field, is fixed by the ``could of witnesses'' who have been with him in the field; and that relying on these, he who has the right needs not to fear. Your friend as ever A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS, IHi. See Lincoln to Stanton, August 10, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>. William G. Greene, Lincoln's old friend of New Salem days, was a prominent Union Democrat. The letter of August 6 which he brought from Governor Yates, Hatch and Dubois, explained that ``there is a deep and general feeling of regret; nay dissatisfaction at the dismissal of Gen'l McClernand from his late command. . . . His<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;384</span></p>
<p>name is indissolubly blended with . . . the great military actions and events occuring in the South West. . . . The popular verdict is irreversibly in his favor as a General. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>On August 24, McClernand replied to Lincoln's letter of August 12:</p>
<p>``Your kind favor, by the hand of Mr. Green, is received. Please accept my grateful acknowledgments for the friendly assurances it contains. If my humble efforts in behalf of the country have in any degree, met your approbation I am rejoiced. I only regret that I am debarred the privilege of continuing them in the same form.</p>
<p>``Feeling that I have done my duty I shrink from no charges that Genl. Grant may prefer. On the contrary . . . I challenged investigation both of his and my conduct. . . . I only ask . . . for an impartial court. Such investigation would bring to light . . . many things, both military and personal, which are unwritten or unheeded. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>On September 14, Stanton replied to McClernand's letter of September 5 in which he repeated his request for a court of inquiry:</p>
<p>``Your letter of the 5th instant has been submitted to the President, who directs me to say that a court of inquiry embracing any one of the subjects specified in that letter would necessarily withdraw from the field many officers whose presence with their commands is absolutely indispensable to the service, and whose absence might cause irreparable injury to the success of operations now in active progress. For these reasons he declines at present your applications, but if hereafter it can be done without prejudice to the service, he will, in view of your anxiety upon the subject, order a court.'' (OR, I, XXIV, I, 169).</p>
<p>On January 14, 1864 , McClernand wrote Lincoln, enclosing a copy of his resignation as major general, ``an office which for more than six months past, has neither afforded me an opportunity to combat the rebellion, nor to defend myself against the proscription and calumnies of . . . Maj. Genl. U. S. Grant.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>

<p>The within discusses a difficult subject---the most difficult with which we have to deal. The able bodied male contrabands are already employed by the Army. But the rest are in confusion and destitution. They better be set to digging their subsistence out of the ground. If there are plantations near you, on either side of the river, which are abandoned by their owners, first put as many contrabands on such, as they will hold---that is, as can draw subsistence from them. If some still remain, get loyal men, of character in the vicinity, to take them temporarily on wages, to be paid to the contrabands themselves---such men obliging themselves to not let the contrabands be kidnapped, or forcibly carried away. Of course, if any voluntarily make arrangements to work for their living, you will not hinder them.

Dix inquired of Governor Seymour ``whether the military power of the State may be relied on to enforce the execution of the [draft] law in case of forcible resistance to it. I am very anxious that there should be perfect harmony between the Federal Government and that of the State of New York, and if, under your authority to see the laws faithfully executed, I can feel assured . . . I need not ask the War Department to put at my disposal . . . troops in the service of the United States . . .'' (OR, III, III, 592). Failing to receive a reply, on August 12, Dix requested 10,000 federal troops and suggested the propriety of the president's calling out the state militia (<span class="rend-i">ibid</span>., pp. 672-74).</p>
<p>On August 15 Seymour answered Dix's letter of July 30, and Dix replied on August 18 as follows:</p>
<p>``I did not receive until last evening your letter of the 15th instant. [A footnote in the source designates the letter as `not found.'] Immediately on my arrival in this city on the 18th ultimo I called upon you with General Canby, and in a subsequent interview with you at my headquarters I expressed the wish that the draft in this state should be executed without the employment of the troops in the service of the United States. In a letter addressed to you on the 30th I renewed more formally the expression of this wish. . . . In the same spirit, when some of the provost-marshals in the interior applied to me for aid against threatened violence, I referred them to you. . . . It was my earnest wish that the Federal arm should neither be seen nor felt. . . . Not having received an answer from you, I applied to the Secretary of War on the 14th instant for a force adequate to the object. The call was promptly responded to and I shall be ready to meet all opposition to the draft. I trust, however, that your determination, of which your letter advises me, to `call into requisition the military power, if need be, to put down violations of good order, riotous proceedings, and disturbances of the public peace, as infractions of the laws of this State,' will render it unnecessary to use the troops. . . .'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>., p. 690).</p>
<p>Under date of August 15 (according to John Hay's <span class="rend-i">Diary</span>, on the night of August 14) Stanton wrote Dix as follows:</p>
<p>``Enclosed herewith I send you by the hands of Colonel Fry---</p>
<p>``1. A Proclamation by the President to be used by you in case of any necessity arising for the employment of military force to overcome unlawful combinations against the authority of the General Government in executing the Act of Congress to enroll and call out the National force. Of this necessity you are authorized to be judge, and if it arises, you will fill up the blanks and promulgate the Proclamation. The original with the Great Seal remains with the Archives of the Government in the State Department.</p>
<p>``2. A call upon the Governor of New York by the President, notifying him to issue orders to Major General Sanford (Charles W.) [<span class="rend-i">sic</span>]. The use of this paper is left to your discretion. It has occurred to the President that it may be proper and servicable to put upon Governor Seymour a call for assistance, and<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;391</span>
let him render it or shoulder the responsibility of refusing. It is not supposed that this call is essential to the authority of the President, or that the assent or obedience of Governor Seymour affects the right or power of the President to issue an order to General Sanford directly. But it may be an expedient courtesy of which you are to judge and which you should have the means of employing if you think proper.</p>
<p>``A blank is left for you to fill up with the State of New York, or any specific districts, as the case may require, and also a blank for date to be filled.</p>
<p>``3. An order by the President upon General Sanford to report to you.</p>
<p>``The date and also the blank for state or specific districts are to be filled up.</p>
<p>``You will be apprised by the Provost Marshal General what reinforcements will be sent forward. He will confer with you. Any further aid or direction you may require, will on notice, be given you if in the power of the Government. . . .'' (Copy, DLC-Stanton Papers).</p>
<p>With Governor Seymour's co-operation, however, Dix found issuance of the proclamation and communications to Sanford and Seymour unnecessary. The draft commenced on August 19, with relative quiet.</p>

<div class="opener">Governor Seymour Executive Mansion,<br>
New-York: Washington, August 16, 1863.</div>
<p>Your despatch of this morning is just received; and, I, fear I do not perfectly understand it.</p>
<p>My view of, the principle is that every soldier obtained voluntarily, leaves one less to be obtained by draft. The only difficulty is, in applying the principle properly. Looking to <span class="rend-i">time</span>, as heretofore I am unwilling to give up a drafted man <span class="rend-i">now</span>, even for the <span class="rend-i">certainty</span>, much less for the mere <span class="rend-i">chance</span>, of getting a volunteer <span class="rend-i">hereafter</span>.</p>
<p>Again, <span class="rend-i">after</span> the draft in any District would it not make trouble to take any drafted man out and put a volunteer in; for how shall it be determined, which drafted man is to have, the previlege of thus going out, to the exclusion of all the others?</p>
<p>And even <span class="rend-i">before</span> the draft in any District the quota must be fixed; and the draft might be postponed indefinitely, if every time a volunteer is offered the officers must stop and reconstruct the quota. At least I fear there might be this difficulty; but, at all events let credits for volunteers be given up to the last moment, which will not produce confusion or delay.</p>
<p>That, the principle of giving credits for volunteers shall be applied by Districts seems fair and proper, though I do not know how far, by present statistics, it is practicable. When, for any cause, a fair credit is not given at one time, it should be given as soon thereafter as practicable.</p>
<p>My purpose is to be just and fair; and yet to not lose time.</p>

My dear Sir: Washington, August 17, 1863.</div>
<p>Months ago I should have acknowledged the receipt of your book, and accompanying kind note; and I now have to beg your pardon for not having done so.</p>
<p>For one of my age, I have seen very little of the drama. The first presentation of Falstaff I ever saw was yours here, last winter or spring. Perhaps the best compliment I can pay is to say, as I truly can, I am very anxious to see it again. Some of Shakspeare's plays I have never read; while others I have gone over perhaps as frequently as any unprofessional reader. Among the latter are Lear, Richard Third, Henry Eighth, Hamlet, and especially Macbeth. I think nothing equals Macbeth. It is wonderful. Unlike you gentlemen of the profession, I think the soliloquy in Hamlet commencing ``O, my offence is rank'' surpasses that commencing ``To be, or not to be.'' But pardon this small attempt at criticism. I should like to hear you pronounce the opening speech of Richard the Third. Will you not soon visit Washington again? If you do,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;393</span>

<p>There seems to be considerable misunderstanding about the recent movement to take possession of the New-Almedan mine. It had no reference to any other mines or miners. In regard to mines and miners generaly, no change of policy by the government has been decided on, or even thought of, so far as I know. The New-Almedan mine was peculiar in this, that its occupants claimed to be the legal owners of it, on a Mexican grant, and went into court on the claim. The case found it's way into the Supreme Court of<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;394</span>
the United States; and last term, in and by that court, the claim of the occupants was decided to be utterly fraudulent. Thereupon it was considered the duty of the government, by the Secretary of the Interior, the Attorney General, and myself, to take possession of the premises; and the Attorney General carefully made out the Writ, and I signed it. It was not obtained surreptitiously, although I suppose Gen. Halleck thought it had been, when he telegraphed, simply because he thought possession was about being taken by a Military order---while he knew no such order had passed through his hands, as General-in-Chief.</p>
<p>The Writ was suspended, upon urgent representations from California, simply to keep the peace. It never had any direct or indirect reference to any mine, place, or person, except the New-Almedan mine, and the persons connected with it.</p>

<p>My appointment of you first as a Brigadier, and then as a Major General, was evidence of my appreciation of your service; and I have not since marked but one thing in connection with you, with which to be dissatisfied. The sending a military order twenty five miles outside of your lines, and all military lines, to take men charged with no offence against the military, out of the hands of the courts, to be turned over to a mob to be hanged, can find no precedent or principle to justify it.<span class="ptr"><a name="6_396_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_396_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> Judge Lynch sometimes takes jurisdiction of cases which prove too strong for the courts; but this is the first case within my knowledge, wherein the court being able to maintain jurisdiction against Judge Lynch, the military has come to the assistance of the latter.

Colt's letter to William Hoffman, commissary general of prisoners, August 18, 1863, requesting the release of Singleton Wilson, bears Hoffman's endorsement referring the letter to Stanton, Stanton's endorsement referring it to General Ethan A. Hitchcock, and Hitchcock's endorsement of disapproval (DLC-RTL). On the bottom of Lincoln's letter Stanton wrote the following endorsement:</p>
<p>``The Secretary of War respectfully reports that in his opinion the release within requested upon the terms stated, should not be granted. He has been over two years voluntarily in the rebel service. He is a young gentleman of education obtained membership in a military organization under pretext of serving the government, has ever since and until his capture at Vicksburg borne arms against the government and is believed to be an officer of an organization that has been distinguished for active &amp; relentless hostility against the United States. If such offences are to be taken out of the general rule of captives of war what should not be? He stands good at least for the release of one Union soldier from bondage. I am unwilling that our soldiers should lose that chance for the sake of favoring one who is so deep in this war and in crime against this government. For this reason as well as those assigned by General Hitchcock I advise against any mitigation of the laws of war in his favor.''</p>

My dear Sir: Washington, August 21. 1863.</div>
<p>In the autumn of 1861, certain persons in armed rebellion, against the United States, within the counties of Acomac and Northampton, laid down their arms upon certain terms then proposed to them by Genl. Dix, in and by a certain procla[ma]tion. It is now said that these persons or some of them, are about to be forced into the military lines of the existing rebellion, unless they will take an oath prescribed to them since, and not included in, Gen. Dix' proclamation referred to. Now, my judgment is that no one of these men should be forced from his home, who has not broken faith with the government, according to the terms fixed by Gen. Dix and these men. It is bad faith in the government to force new terms upon such as have kept faith with it. At least so it seems to me.</p>

<div class="textindentlevelx">
<div class="opener">Hon. James C. Conkling Executive Mansion,<br>
My Dear Sir. Washington, August 26, 1863.</div>
<p>Your letter inviting me to attend a mass-meeting of unconditional Union-men, to be held at the Capital of Illinois, on the 3d day of September, has been received.</p>
<p>It would be very agreeable to me, to thus meet my old friends, at my own home; but I can not, just now, be absent from here, so long as a visit there, would require.</p>
<p>The meeting is to be of all those who maintain unconditional devotion to the Union; and I am sure my old political friends will thank me for tendering, as I do, the nation's gratitude to those other noble men, whom no partizan malice, or partizan hope, can make false to the nation's life.</p>
<p>There<span class="ptr"><a name="6_406_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_406_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> are those who are dissatisfied with me. To such I would say: You desire peace; and you blame me that we do not have it.<span class="ptr"><a name="6_406_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_406_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> But how can we attain it? There are but three conceivable ways. First, to suppress the rebellion by force of arms. This, I am trying to do. Are you for it? If you are, so far we are agreed. If you are not for it, a second way is, to give up the Union. I am against this.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;407</span>Are you for it? If you are, you should say so plainly. If you are not for <span class="rend-i">force</span>, nor yet for <span class="rend-i">dissolution</span>, there only remains some imaginable <span class="rend-i">compromise</span>. I do not believe any compromise, embracing the maintenance of the Union, is now possible. All I learn, leads to a directly opposite belief. The strength of the rebellion, is its military---its army. That army dominates all the country, and all the people, within its range. Any offer of terms made by any man or men within that range, in opposition to that army, is simply nothing for the present; because such man or men, have no power whatever to enforce their side of a compromise, if one were made with them. To<span class="ptr"><a name="6_407_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_407_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[4]</a></span> illustrate---Suppose refugees from the South, and peace men of the North, get together in convention, and frame and proclaim a compromise embracing a restoration of the Union; in what way can that compromise be used to keep Lee's army out of Pennsylvania? Meade's army can keep Lee's army out of Pennsylvania; and, I think, can ultimately drive it out of existence. But no paper compromise, to which the controllers of Lee's army are not agreed, can, at all, affect that army. In an effort at such compromise we should waste time, which the enemy would improve to our disadvantage; and that would be all. A compromise, to be effective, must be made either with those who control the rebel army, or<span class="ptr"><a name="6_407_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_407_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[5]</a></span> with the people first liberated from the domination of that army, by the success of our own army. Now allow me to assure you, that no word or intimation, from that rebel army, or from any of the men controlling it, in relation to any peace compromise, has ever come to my knowledge or belief. All charges and insinuations to the contrary, are<span class="ptr"><a name="6_407_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_407_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[6]</a></span> deceptive and groundless. And I promise you, that if any such proposition shall hereafter come, it shall not be rejected, and kept a secret from you. I freely acknowledge myself the servant of the people, according to the bond of service---the United States constitution; and that, as such, I am responsible to them.</p>
<p>But, to be plain, you are dissatisfied with me about the negro. Quite likely there is a difference of opinion between you and myself upon that subject. I certainly wish that all men<span class="ptr"><a name="6_407_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_407_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[7]</a></span> could be free, while I suppose you do not. Yet I have neither adopted, nor proposed any measure, which is not consistent with even your view, provided you are for the Union. I suggested compensated emancipation;<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;408</span>
to which you replied you wished not to be taxed to buy negroes. But I had not asked you to be taxed to buy negroes, except in such way, as to save you from greater taxation to save the Union exclusively by other means.</p>
<p>You dislike the emancipation proclamation; and, perhaps, would have it retracted. You say it is unconstitutional---I think differently. I think the constitution invests its commander-in-chief, with the law of war, in time of war. The most that can be said, if so much, is, that slaves are property. Is there---has there ever been---any question that by the law of war, property, both of enemies and friends, may be taken when needed? And is it not needed whenever taking it, helps us, or hurts the enemy? Armies, the world over, destroy enemies' property when they can not use it; and even destroy their own to keep it from the enemy. Civilized belligerents do all<span class="ptr"><a name="6_408_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_408_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[8]</a></span> in their power to help themselves, or hurt the enemy, except a few things regarded as barbarous or cruel. Among the exceptions are the massacre of vanquished foes, and non-combatants, male and female.</p>
<p>But the proclamation, as law, either is valid, or is not valid. If<span class="ptr"><a name="6_408_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_408_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[9]</a></span> it is not valid, it needs no retraction. If it is valid, it can not be retracted, any more than the dead can be brought to life. Some of you profess to think its retraction would operate favorably<span class="ptr"><a name="6_408_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_408_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[10]</a></span> for the Union. Why better <span class="rend-i">after</span> the retraction, than <span class="rend-i">before</span> the issue? There was more than a year and a half of trial to suppress the rebellion before the proclamation issued, the last one hundred days of which passed under an explicit notice that it was coming, unless averted by those in revolt, returning to their allegiance. The war has certainly progressed as favorably for us, since the issue of the proclamation as before.<span class="ptr"><a name="6_408_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_408_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[11]</a></span> I<span class="ptr"><a name="6_408_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_408_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[12]</a></span> know as fully as one can know the opinions of others, that some of the commanders of our armies in the field who have given us our most important successes, believe the emancipation<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;409</span>
policy, and the use of colored troops, constitute the heaviest blow yet dealt to the rebellion; and that, at least one of those important successes, could not have been achieved when it was, but for the aid of black soldiers. Among the commanders holding these views are some who have never had any affinity with what is called abolitionism, or with republican party politics; but who hold them purely as military opinions. I submit these opinions as being entitled to some weight against the objections, often urged, that emancipation, and arming the blacks, are unwise as military measures, and were not adopted, as such, in good faith.</p>
<p>You say you will not fight to free negroes. Some<span class="ptr"><a name="6_409_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_409_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[13]</a></span> of them seem willing to fight for you; but, no matter. Fight you, then, exclusively to save the Union. I issued the proclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the Union. Whenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the Union, if I shall urge you to continue fighting, it will be an apt time, then, for you to declare you will not fight to free negroes.</p>
<p>I thought that in your struggle for the Union, to whatever extent the negroes should cease helping the enemy, to that extent it weakened the enemy in his resistance to you. Do you think differently? I thought that whatever negroes can be got to do as soldiers, leaves just so much less for white soldiers to do, in saving the Union. Does it appear otherwise to you? But negroes, like other people, act<span class="ptr"><a name="6_409_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_409_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[14]</a></span> upon motives. Why should they do any thing for us, if we will do nothing for them? If they stake their lives for us, they must be prompted by the strongest motive---even the promise of freedom. And the promise being made, must be kept.<span class="ptr"><a name="6_409_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_409_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[15]</a></span></p>
<p>The signs look better. The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the sea. Thanks to the great North-West for it. Nor yet wholly to them. Three hundred miles up, they met New-England, Empire, Key-Stone, and Jersey, hewing their way right and left. The Sunny South too, in more colors than one, also lent a hand. On the spot, their part of the history was jotted down in black and white. The job was a great national one; and let none be banned who bore an honorable part in it. And while those who have cleared the great river may well be proud, even that is not all. It is hard to say that anything has been more bravely, and well done, than at Antietam, Murfreesboro, Gettysburg, and on many fields of lesser note. Nor must Uncle Sam's Web-feet be forgotten. At all the watery margins they have been present. Not only on the deep sea,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;410</span>
the broad bay, and the rapid river, but also up the narrow muddy bayou, and wherever the ground was a little damp, they have been, and made their tracks. Thanks to all. For the great republic---for the principle it lives by, and keeps alive---for man's vast future,--- thanks to all.</p>
<p>Peace does not appear so distant as it did. I hope it will come soon, and come to stay; and so come as to be worth the keeping in all future time. It will then have been proved that, among free men, there can be no successful appeal from the ballot to the bullet; and that they who take such appeal are sure to lose their case, and pay the cost. And then, there will be some black men who can remember that, with silent tongue, and clenched teeth, and steady eye, and well-poised<span class="ptr"><a name="6_410_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_410_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[16]</a></span> bayonet, they have helped mankind on to this great consummation; while, I fear, there will be some white ones, unable to forget that, with malignant heart, and deceitful speech, they have strove to hinder it.</p>
<p>Still let us not be over-sanguine of a speedy final triumph. Let us be quite sober. Let us diligently apply the means, never doubting that a just God, in his own good time, will give us the rightful result. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN.</p>

<p>Suppose those now in rebellion should say: ``We cease fighting: re-establish the national authority amongst us---customs, courts, mails, land-offices,---all as before the rebellion---we claiming to send members to both branches of Congress, as of yore, and to hold our slaves according to our State laws, notwithstanding anything or all things which has occurred during the rebellion.'' I probably should answer: ``It will be difficult to justify in reason, or to maintain in fact, a war on one side, which shall have ceased on the other. You began the war, and you can end it. If questions remain, let them be solved by peaceful means---by courts, and votes. This war is an appeal, by you, from the ballot to the sword; and a great object with me has been to teach the futility of such appeal---to teach that what is decided by the ballot, can not be reversed by the sword---to teach that there can be no successful appeal from a fair election, but to the next election. Whether persons sent to congress, will be admitted to seats is, by the constitution, left to each House to decide, the President having nothing to do with it. Yet the question can not<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;411</span>
be one of indifference to me. I shall dread, and I think we all should dread, to see the `the disturbing element' so brought back into the government, as to make probable a renewal of the terrible scenes through which we are now passing. During my continuance here, the government will return no person to slavery who is free according to the proclamation, or to any of the acts of congress, unless such return shall be held to be a legal duty, by the proper court of final resort, in which case I will promptly act as may then appear to be my personal duty.['']</p>
<p>Congress has left to me very large powers to remit forfeitures and personal penalties; and I should exercise these to the greatest extent which might seem consistent with the future public safety. I have thus told you, once more, so far as it is for me to say, what you are fighting for. The prospects of the Union have greatly improved recently; still, let us not be over-sanguine of a speedy final triumph. Let us diligently apply the means, never doubting that a just God, in his own good time, will give us the rightful result.</p>

Dear Sir: Washington, August 26, 1863.</div>
<p>Your note, asking what you were to understand, was received yesterday. Monday morning, I sent the papers to the Secretary of<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;412</span>
the Interior, with an indorsement that my impression of the law was not changed, and that I desired him to take up the case and do his duty according to his view of the law. Yesterday I said the same thing to him verbally.</p>
<p>Now, my understanding is that the law has not assigned me, specifically, any duty in the case, but has assigned it to the Secretary of the Interior. It may be my general duty to direct him to act; which I have performed. When he shall have acted, if his action is not satisfactory, there may, or may not, be an appeal to me. It is a point I have not examined; but if then it be shown that the law gives such appeal, I shall not hesitate to entertain it when presented. Yours truly A LINCOLN</p>

<p>In my correspondence with Gov. Seymour in relation to the draft, I have said to him, substantially, that credits shall be given for volunteers up to the latest moment, before drawing in any district, that can be done without producing confusion or delay. In order to do this, let our mustering officers in New-York, and elsewhere, be at once instructed that whenever they muster into our service any number of volunteers, to at once make return to the War Department, both by telegraph and mail, the date of the muster, the number mustered, and the Congressional or enrolment District, or Districts, of their residences, giving the number separately for each District. Keep these returns diligently posted, and by them give full credit on the quotas, if possible, on the last day before the draft begins in any District.</p>
<p>Again, I have informed Governor Seymour that he shall be notified of the time when the draft is to commence in each District in his State. This is equally proper for all the States. In order to carry it out, I propose that so soon as the day for commencing the draft in any District is definitely determined, the Governor of the</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;413</span>State, including the District, be notified thereof, both by telegraph and mail, in form, about as follows:</p>
<p>.....</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS, RPB. The despatch which Lincoln forwarded was received from Representative Abel C. Wilder and Senator James H. Lane on August 26 at 8:45 P.M., and read: ``The result of the massacre at Lawrence having excited feelings amongst our people, which makes a collision between them &amp; the military probable, the imbecility &amp; incapacity of Schofield is most deplorable. Our people unanimously demand the removal of Schofield, whose policy has opened Kansas to invasion &amp; butchery'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>On August 28, General Schofield replied to Lincoln as follows:</p>
<p>``Since the capture of Vicksburg a considerable portion of the rebel army in the Mississippi Valley has disbanded, and large numbers of men have come back to Missouri . . . some . . . under instructions to carry on a guerrilla warfare, and others, men of the worst character, become marauders on their own account. . . .</p>
<p>``Under instructions from the rebel authorities, as I am informed and believe, considerable bands, called `Border Guards,' were organized in the counties of Missouri bordering on Kansas, for the ostensible purpose of protecting those counties from inroads from Kansas, and preventing slaves of rebels from escaping from Missouri into Kansas. . . .</p>
<p>``Upon the representation of General Ewing and others . . . I became satisfied there could be no cure for the evil short of the removal from those counties of all slaves entitled to their freedom, and of the families of all men known to belong to these bands, and others who were known to sympathize with them.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;416</span>Accordingly I directed General Ewing to adopt and carry out the policy he had indicated, warning him, however, of the retaliation which might be attempted. . . .</p>
<p>``Almost immediately after it became known that such policy had been adopted, [William C.] Quantrill secretly assembled from several of the border counties of Missouri about 300 of his men. They met at a preconcerted place . . . near the Kansas line, at about sunset, and immediately marched for Lawrence, which place they reached at daylight the next morning. They sacked and burned the town and murdered the citizens in the most barbarous manner.</p>
<p>``It is easy to see that any unguarded town in a country where such a number of outlaws can be assembled is liable to a similar fate, if the villains are willing to risk the retribution which must follow. . . .</p>
<p>``I am officially informed that a large meeting has been held at Leavenworth, in which a resolution was adopted to the effect that the people would assemble at a certain place on the border, on the 8th of September, for the purpose of entering Missouri to search for their stolen property. Efforts have been made by the mayor of Leavenworth to get possession of the ferry at that place for the purpose of crossing armed parties of citizens into Northern Missouri.</p>
<p>``I have strong reasons for believing that the authors of the telegram to you are among those who introduced and obtained the adoption of the Leavenworth resolution, and who are endeavoring to organize a force for the purpose of general retaliation upon Missouri. Those who so deplore my `imbecility and incapacity' are the very men who are endeavoring to bring about a collision between the people of Kansas and the troops under General Ewing's command. I have not the `capacity' to see the wisdom or justice of permitting an irresponsible mob to enter Missouri for the purpose of retaliation even for so grievous a wrong as that which Lawrence has suffered.</p>
<p>``I have increased the force upon the border . . . and no effort will be spared to punish the invaders of Kansas and to prevent such acts in future. . . .'' (<span class="rend-b">OR, I, XXII, II,</span> 482-84).</p>

<p>``The Common Council Chicago on the tenth inst appropriated one hundred &amp; twenty thousand (120000) dollars to be expended in procuring volunteers to take the place of poor men with families who might be drafted from Chicago. They appointed a committee of eleven including the undersigned to take charge of the business and specially authorized them to correspond &amp; confer with any of the Federal authorities [``They should confer with the Governor as we cannot correspond direct with all the civil authorities J B FRY''] in relation to the fairness of the conscription---the acceptance of said Volunteers in lieu of drafted men and such other matters as might pertain to the efficient performance of their duties under the ordinance. A sub committee appointed to wait on the boards of enrolment reported that they were informed by the board that the number of names enrolled for this city was over twenty eight thousand (28000) while the entire vote of the city was twenty thousand three hundred &amp; forty seven (20347) That they (the sub committee) believed the enrolment contained forty percent or eight thousand (8000) more names than could have been legally entered [``I don't see how the vote of the city can control the question of the legality of the Enrolment. If a man didn't choose to vote does it follow from that that it is illegal to enrol him? No such cause of exemption is provided in the law JBF''] &amp; requested of the board permission to take a copy of the corrected consolidated list in order to canvass it &amp; suggest corrections---that<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;418</span>
the request was refused on the ground among others that the list had been sealed up and the board did not feel authorized to unseal it without authority from Washington There upon the committee adopted the following Resolution.</p>
<p>`` `Resolved that a sub committee to be composed of the Mayor &amp; Comptroller be &amp; is hereby appointed to obtain from the President . . . or other proper authority permission for the committee to take copies of the corrected consolidated enrolment list of this District which embraces the City, now on file in the office of the board of Enrolment of this District &amp; such other documents &amp; papers as will enable this committee to ascertain the correctness or incorrectness of said list &amp; all other matters pertaining to the draft in this city.'

We have opened correspondence with the Governors in regard to everything which affects their States or any part of the same &amp; we are prepared to give the Governors anything they deem necessary for the welfare of the States or any part of them.'']</p>
<p>``The undersigned accordingly represent that the desire of the committee &amp; the City authorities is not to impede in any way the execution of the Conscription Law but only to secure Justice and prevent unfairness in its operation upon the people of Chicago [``I don't think the people of Chicago have any reason to anticipate injustice or unfairness J B FRY'']---to properly administer the funds and perform the duties committed to them &amp; incidentally to preserve the public peace. They desire to take a copy of said list for examination the same having never been published that they may urge such corrections as are important &amp; time will permit &amp; they Respectfully request you Mr President to authorize &amp; direct the sealed consolidated list for the Chicago District on file in the enrolment office here to be unsealed and permission given the conscription war fund committee to take a copy of the same at the expense of the City.''

A thirty-page report submitted on September 10, 1863, by Major Henry Z. Hayner, aide-de-camp on General Schenck's staff, indicates that the difficulties on the Eastern Shore of Virginia were twofold. Several hundred citizens formerly in the ``39th Rebel Regiment'' had accepted amnesty offered by General Dix on the simple provision that they lay down their arms. Later, upon being required by Schenck to take an oath of allegiance, or (1) to be regarded as prisoners of war and put up for exchange, or (2) to be sent beyond Union lines; they objected to the oath on grounds of conscience, regarding themselves as still bound by their oath of allegiance to the Confederacy. The second phase of the difficulty concerned the destruction of a lighthouse by unknown persons. Two hundred and twenty-one residents of Northampton were assessed $20,000 on the grounds that the community was responsible, and collections were made from one hundred and sixty-one, over their violent protests. Hayner's report indicates that the order suspending the oath and assessments were received in a spirit of triumph over the government (DLC-RTL).</p>

My dear Sir: Washington, September 2. 1863.</div>
<p>Knowing your great anxiety that the emancipation proclamation shall now be applied to certain parts of Virginia and Louisiana which were exempted from it last January, I state briefly what appear to me to be difficulties in the way of such a step. The original proclamation has no constitutional or legal justification, except as a military measure. The exemptions were made because the military necessity did not apply to the exempted localities. Nor does that necessity apply to them now any more than it did then. If I take the step must I not do so, without the argument of military<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;429</span>
necessity, and so, without any argument, except the one that I think the measure politically expedient, and morally right? Would I not thus give up all footing upon constitution or law? Would I not thus be in the boundless field of absolutism? Could this pass unnoticed, or unresisted? Could it fail to be perceived that without any further stretch, I might do the same in Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri; and even change any law in any state? Would not many of our own friends shrink away appalled? Would it not lose us the elections, and with them, the very cause we seek to advance?</p>

<p>``We are in receipt of your dispatch dated August 27th, in answer to our communication of the 24th. inst.</p>
<p>``We have not been able to discover in the act of Congress, known as the Conscription act, or in the practice of the Government under it, any such clear and distinct recognition of state authority, as to authorise the impression that such an application as that which we had the honor to make on behalf and at the request of the Committee of the Common Council, would create confusion unless first submitted to the Governor of the State.</p>
<p>``The enrollment list is a record of the names of the persons reported to be liable, in demand of the Government, to be called directly into the field to undergo the hardships and dangers of military service. It would seem reasonable that such a record should be kept open for public inspection in the district for which it was made. . . .</p>
<p>``We are however contented to apply to the State authorities. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>Upon being denied access to the consolidated enrollment list by Lieutenant Colonel James Oakes, assistant provost marshal general for Illinois, Sherman and Hayes wrote Lincoln again on September 17:</p>
<p>`` . . . What we seek is . . . information, clear and definite, of each and all of the names as they stand on the list from which the draft will be made. We wish to know who have been enrolled, who have been omitted, and who have been enrolled more than once. That knowledge we cannot obtain from the original lists. It can only be had from the corrected or final enrollment, which is now sealed up.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;436</span>``Our object is to secure equal rights to this community, and especially to protect the ignorant and poor from injustice and oppression, to bring such cases, if we find any, to the attention of the Government for correction, and thereby to promote harmony, and mutual reliance, and concert of action between all classes of the people in doing whatever may be necessary and right to suppress the rebellion, and preserve our constitutional system---amidst the trials to which it is exposed.</p>
<p>``We have not yet surrendered the hope that further reflection may lead you to order a compliance with our request. We venture to add . . . that in our humble judgment a general order of the same nature, applicable to all the districts in the United States would tend greatly to strengthen the confidence of the people in the Government, and to promote the public good.''

The whole struggle for Tennessee will have been profitless to both State and Nation, if it so ends that Gov. Johnson is put down, and Gov. Harris is put up. It must not be so. You must have it otherwise. Let the reconstruction be the work of such men only as can be trusted for the Union. Exclude all others, and trust that your government, so organized, will be recognized here, as being the one of republican form, to be guarranteed to the state, and to be protected against invasion and domestic violence.</p>
<p>It is something on the question of <span class="rend-i">time</span>, to remember that it can not be known who is next to occupy the position I now hold, nor what he will do.</p>
<p>I see that you have declared in favor of emancipation in Tennessee, for which, may God bless you. Get emancipation into your new State government---Constitution---and there will be no such word as fail for your case.</p>

<div class="textindentlevelx">
<div class="opener">[September 14? 1863]</div>
<p>It is at all times proper that misunderstanding between the public and the public servant should be avoided; and this is far more important<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;445</span>
now, than in times of peace and tranquility. I therefore address you without searching for a precedent upon which to do so. Some of you are sincerely devoted to the republican institutions, and territorial integrity of our country, and yet are opposed to what is called the draft, or conscription.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, and ever since, a variety of motives pressing, some in one direction and some in the other, would be presented to the mind of each man physically fit for a soldier, upon the combined effect of which motives, he would, or would not, voluntarily enter the service. Among these motives would be patriotism, political bias, ambition, personal courage, love of adventure, want of employment, and convenience, or the opposites of some of these. We already have, and have had in the service, as appears, substantially all that can be obtained upon this voluntary weighing of motives. And yet we must somehow obtain more, or relinquish the original object of the contest, together with all the blood and treasure already expended in the effort to secure it. To meet this necessity the law for the draft has been enacted. You who do not wish to be soldiers, do not like this law. This is natural; nor does it imply want of patriotism. Nothing can be so just, and necessary, as to make us like it, if it is disagreeable to us. We are prone, too, to find false arguments with which to excuse ourselves for opposing such disagreeable things. In this case those who desire the rebellion to succeed, and others who seek reward in a different<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;446</span>
way, are very active in accomodating us with this class of arguments. They tell us the law is unconstitutional. It is the first instance, I believe, in which the power of congress to do a thing has ever been questioned, in a case when the power is given by the constitution in express terms. Whether a power can be implied, when it is not expressed, has often been the subject of controversy; but this is the first case in which the degree of effrontery has been ventured upon, of denying a power which is plainly and distinctly written down in the constitution. The constitution declares that ``The congress shall have power . . . To raise and support armies; but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years.'' The whole scope of the conscription act is ``to raise and support armies.'' There is nothing else in it. It makes no appropriation of money; and hence the money clause just quoted, is not touched by it. The case simply is the constitution provides that the congress shall have power to raise and support armies; and, by this act, the congress has exercised the power to raise and support armies. This is the whole of it. It is a law made in litteral pursuance of this part of the United States Constitution; and another part of the same constitution declares that ``This constitution, and the laws made in pursuance thereof . . . shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.''</p>
<p>Do you admit that the power is given to raise and support armies, and yet insist that by this act congress has not exercised the power in a constitutional mode?---has not done the thing, in the right way? Who is to judge of this? The constitution gives congress the power, but it does not prescribe the mode, or expressly declare who shall prescribe it. In such case congress must prescribe the mode, or relinquish the power. There is no alternative. Congress could not exercise the power to do the thing, if it had not the power of providing a way to do it, when no way is provided by the constitution for doing it. In fact congress would not have the power to raise and support armies, if even by the constitution, it were left to the option of any other, or others, to give or withhold the only mode of doing it. If the constitution had prescribed a mode, congress could and must follow that mode; but as it is, the mode necessarily goes to congress, with the power expressly given. The power is given fully, completely, unconditionally. It is not a power to raise armies <span class="rend-i">if</span> State authorities consent; nor <span class="rend-i">if</span> the men to compose the armies are entirely willing; but it is a power to raise and support armies given to congress by the constitution, without an if.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;447</span>It is clear that a constitutional law may not be expedient or proper. Such would be a law to raise armies when no armies were needed. But this is not such. The republican institutions, and territorial integrity of our country can not be maintained without the further raising and supporting of armies. There can be no army without men. Men can be had only voluntarily, or involuntarily. We have ceased to obtain them voluntarily; and to obtain them involuntarily, is the draft---the conscription. If you dispute the fact, and declare that men can still be had voluntarily in sufficient numbers prove the assertion by yourselves volunteering in such numbers, and I shall gladly give up the draft. Or if not a sufficient number, but any one of you will volunteer, he for his single self, will escape all the horrors of the draft; and will thereby do only what each one of at least a million of his mainly brethren have already done. Their toil and blood have been given as much for you as for themselves. Shall it all be lost rather than you too, will bear your part?</p>
<p>I do not say that all who would avoid serving in the war, are unpatriotic; but I do think every patriot should willingly take his chance under a law made with great care in order to secure entire fairness. This law was considered, discussed, modified, and amended, by congress, at great length, and with much labor; and was finally passed, by both branches, with a near approach to unanimity. At last, it may not be exactly such as any one man out of congress, or even in congress, would have made it. It has been said, and I believe truly, that the constitution itself is not altogether such as any one of it's framers would have preferred. It was the joint work of all; and certainly the better that it was so.</p>
<p>Much complaint is made of that provision of the conscription law which allows a drafted man to substitute three hundred dollars for himself; while, as I believe, none is made of that provision which allows him to substitute another man for himself. Nor is the three hundred dollar provision objected to for unconstitutionality; but for inequality---for favoring the rich against the poor. The substitution of men is the provision if any, which favors the rich to the exclusion of the poor. But this being a provision in accordance with an old and well known practice, in the raising of armies, is not objected to. There would have been great objection if that provision had been omitted. And yet being in, the money provision really modifies the inequality which the other introduces. It allows men to escape the service, who are too poor to escape but for it. Without the money provision, competition among the more wealthy might, and probably would, raise the price of substitutes<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;448</span>
above three hundred dollars, thus leaving the man who could raise only three hundred dollars, no escape from personal service. True, by the law as it is, the man who can not raise so much as three hundred dollars, nor obtain a personal substitute for less, can not escape; but he can come quite as near escaping as he could if the money provision were not in the law. To put it another way, is an unobjectionable law which allows only the man to escape who can pay a thousand dollars, made objectionable by adding a provision that any one may escape who can pay the smaller sum of three hundred dollars? This is the exact difference at this point between the present law and all former draft laws. It is true that by this law a some what larger number will escape than could under a law allowing personal substitutes only; but each additional man thus escaping will be [a] poorer man than could have escaped by the law in the other form. The money provision enlarges the class of exempts from actual service simply by admitting poorer men into it. How, then can this money provision be a wrong to the poor man? The inequality complained of pertains in greater degree to the substitution of men, and is really modified and lessened by the money provision. The inequality could only be perfectly cured by sweeping both provisions away. This being a great innovation, would probably leave the law more distasteful than it now is.</p>
<p>The principle of the draft, which simply is involuntary, or enforced service, is not new. It has been practiced in all ages of the world. It was well known to the framers of our constitution as one of the modes of raising armies, at the time they placed in that instrument the provision that ``the congress shall have power to raise and support armies.'' It has been used, just before, in establishing our independence; and it was also used under the constitution in 1812. Wherein is the peculiar hardship now? Shall we shrink from the necessary means to maintain our free government, which our grand-fathers employed to establish it, and our own fathers have already employed once to maintain it? Are we degenerate? Has the manhood of our race run out?</p>
<p>Again, a law may be both constitutional and expedient, and yet may be administered in an unjust and unfair way. This law belongs to a class, which class is composed of those laws whose object is to distribute burthens or benefits on the principle of equality. No one of these laws can ever be practically administered with that exactness which can be conceived of in the mind. A tax law, the principle of which is that each owner shall pay in proproportion [<span class="rend-i">sic</span>] to the value of his property, will be a dead letter, if no one can be compelled to pay until it can be shown that every other one will<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;449</span>
pay in precisely the same proportion according to value; nay even, it will be a dead letter, if no one can be compelled to pay until it is certain that every other one will pay at all---even in unequal proportion. Again the United States House of representatives is constituted on the principle that each member is sent by the same number of people that each other one is sent by; and yet in practice no two of the whole number, much less the whole number, are ever sent by precisely the same number of constituents. The Districts can not be made precisely equal in population at first, and if they could, they would become unequal in a single day, and much more so in the ten years, which the Districts, once made, are to continue. They can not be re-modelled every day; nor, without too much expence and labor, even every year.</p>
<p>This sort of difficulty applies in full force, to the practical administration of the draft law. In fact the difficulty is greater in the case of the draft law. First, it starts with all the inequality of the congressional Districts; but these are based on entire population, while the draft is based upon those only who are fit for soldiers, and such may not bear the same proportion to the whole in one District, that they do in another. Again, the facts must be ascertained, and credit given, for the unequal numbers of soldiers which have already gone from the several Districts. In all these points errors will occur in spite of the utmost fidelity. The government is bound to administer the law with such an approach to exactness as is usual in analagous cases, and as entire good faith and fidelity will reach. If so great departures as to be inconsistent with such good faith and fidelity, or great departures occurring in any way, be pointed out, they shall be corrected; and any agent shown to have caused such departures intentionally, shall be dismissed.</p>
<p>With these views, and on these principles, I feel bound to tell you it is my purpose to see the draft law faithfully executed.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; AD, DLC-RTL. Nicolay and Hay date this document ``August [15?] 1863'' (NH, IX, 74), but a bracketed date on the first page of the manuscript reads ``[Aug 30?] 1863.'' From the contents it may be inferred that Lincoln intended to use the piece either as a public address or as part of a communication. An endorsement by Robert Todd Lincoln written on the back of the last page of the manuscript reads: ``This Mss. was probably written at the time of the Sprd. Letter of Aug---63---but not incorporated with it &amp; never published.'' The reference is, of course, to Lincoln's letter to James C. Conkling, August 26, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>, but it would seem more probable that Lincoln contemplated issuance of his sentiments on the draft to counteract the numerous efforts to block enforcement of the law. Gideon Welles refers to such a paper as having been prepared by the president on September 14, but abandoned in favor of the proclamation of September 15, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>, suspending habeas corpus with respect to persons taken by the draft. Welles' <span class="rend-i">Diary</span> records the Cabinet discussion:</p>
<p>``September 14, Monday. The President called a special Cabinet council this morning at eleven. The course pursued by certain judges is, he says, defeating the draft. They are discharging the drafted men rapidly under <span class="rend-i">habeas corpus</span>, and he is determined to put a stop to these factious and mischievous proceedings if he has the authority. The Secretary of State and Attorney-General have each been consulted and declare they have no doubt of his authority. Mr. Blair was satisfied the President had the legal power, but whether the measure proposed, which is an order from the President directing the provost marshals to disregard the writ, or to make return that the persons to be discharged was held by authority of the President, was perhaps not the best process [see draft of order, September 17, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>]. Mr. Chase feared civil war would be inaugurated if the privilege of the writ of <span class="rend-i">habeas corpus</span> was suspended. Mr. Usher had doubts and uncertainties.</p>
<p>``The President was very determined, and intimated that he would not only enforce the law, but if Judge Lowry [Chief Justice Walter H. Lowrie, Supreme Court of Pennsylvania] and others continued to interfere and interrupt the draft he would send them after Vallandigham. As considerable discussion had taken place, he was prepared to act, though willing to listen to, and, if mistaken, to defer to, others. Up to this point neither Mr. Stanton or myself had taken part in the discussion, though Stanton had undoubtedly expressed his opinion and prompted the proposed action.</p>
<p>``I remarked that the subject was not new to me, . . . I had as high regard and reverence for that writ as any one, but it seemed to me there should be some way to prevent its abuse. A factious and evil-minded judge . . . could embarrass the Government, could delay the departure of a vessel . . . could stop armies on the march . . . .</p>
<p>``The President said he would prepare and submit a paper at an adjourned meeting for criticism to-morrow at 9 A.M.</p>
<p>``September 15, Tuesday. The President read the paper which he had drawn up. Mr. Chase proposed as a preferable course that the President should, pursuant to the act of the 3rd of March last, suspend by proclamation the privilege of the writ of <span class="rend-i">habeas corpus</span> on military questions. This proposition . . . met with favor from all, and the Council adjourned to 1 P.M. for Mr. Seward to prepare a proclamation. On meeting . . . the draft which Mr. Seward had prepared was criticized and after some modifications was ordered to be recopied and carried into effect. All came into the arrangement cordially after Stanton read the reports of sundry provost marshals and others detailing the schemes practiced for defeating the draft . . . .''</p>

Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do hereby proclaim and make known to all whom it may concern, that the privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus is suspended throughout the United States in the several cases before mentioned, and that this suspension will continue throughout the duration of the said rebellion, or until this proclamation shall, by a subsequent one to be issued by the President of the United States, be modified or revoked. And I do hereby require all magistrates, attorneys and other civil officers within the United States, and all officers and others in the military and<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;452</span>

<p>The Hon: Abraham D. Smith, Hon: William E. Wording, and Hon: William Henry Brisbane, Tax Commissioners for the District of South Carolina:</p>
<p>Whereas, you were duly appointed a Board of Tax Commissioners, for the District of South Carolina, wherein by reason of insurrection and rebellion, the civil authority of the Government of the United States, has been and continues to be obstructed, so that the provisions of the act entitled ``An act to provide increased revenue from imports, to pay interest on the public debt, and for ``other purposes,'' approved August. 5. 1861, could not be peaceably executed; and</p>
<p>Whereas, heretofore, to wit, in the months of February and March of the present year, you as Commissioners aforesaid caused certain lots and parcels of land situated in the Parish of St. Helena in said State, to be sold for the direct taxes, unpaid and charged on the same: and</p>
<p>Whereas, at said sale you struck off to the United States, divers of said lots and parcels of land at certain sums, equal in each case, to at least the tax penalty and costs, and ten per cent interest on said tax charged on each lot or parcel of land respectively; pursuant to public notice therefore given; and</p>
<p>Whereas, the owners of said lots and parcels of land so struck<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;454</span>
off to the United States, have abandoned the same, and have not paid the taxes thereon, nor redeemed them, and</p>

<p>Second. If upon such sale, any person serving in the army or navy or marine corps, shall become a purchaser, and shall pay one fourth part of the purchase money pursuant to the provisions of the said eleventh section of the said act of congress, the said Commissioners shall issue a certificate for the said tract or parcel of land so purchased, subject nevertheless to the payment of the residue of the purchase money in three years from the date of said sale, either in money or in certificates of indebtedness of the United States, and subject also to the condition that he, his heirs or assigns shall commit no waste upon the premises sold: and in case he or they shall fail to pay the residue of the said purchase money, within the time limited for the payment, thereof, or shall at any time prior to the full payment of the purchase money in cash or in certificates of indebtedness as aforesaid, with interest, if any, due upon the same, together with costs, commit any waste, it shall and may be lawful for said Commissioners, or their successors in office, to enter upon the said premises and to sell the same for the payment of the purchase money due the United States, returning the<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;455</span>

Major General Halleck: Washington, Sept. 19. 1863.</div>
<p>By Gen. Meade's despatch to you of yesterday it appears that he desires your views and those of the government, as to whether he shall advance upon the enemy. I am not prepared to order, or even advise an advance in this case, wherein I know so little of particulars, and wherein he, in the field, thinks the risk is so great, and the promise of advantage so small. And yet the case presents matter for very serious consideration in another aspect. These two<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;467</span>
armies confront each other across a small river, substantially midway between the two Capitals, each defending it's own Capital, and menacing the other. Gen. Meade estimates the enemies infantry in front of him at not less than forty thousand. Suppose we add fifty per cent to this, for cavalry, artillery, and extra duty men stretching as far as Richmond, making the whole force of the enemy sixty thousand. Gen. Meade, as shown by the returns, has with him, and between him and Washington, of the same classes of well men, over ninety thousand. Neither can bring the whole of his men into a battle; but each can bring as large a per centage in as the other. For a battle, then, Gen. Meade has three men to Gen. Lee's two. Yet, it having been determined that choosing ground, and standing on the defensive, gives so great advantage that the three can not safely attack the two, the three are left simply standing on the defensive also. If the enemies sixty thousand are sufficient to keep our ninety thousand away from Richmond, why, by the same rule, may not forty thousand of ours keep their sixty thousand away from Washington, leaving us fifty thousand to put to some other use? Having practically come to the mere defensive, it seems to be no economy at all to employ twice as many men for that object as are needed. With no object, certainly, to misle[a]d myself, I can perceive no fault in this statement, unless we admit we are not the equal of the enemy man for man. I hope you will consider it.</p>
<p>To avoid misunderstanding, let me say that to attempt to fight the enemy slowly back into his intrenchments at Richmond, and there to capture him, is an idea I have been trying to repudiate for quite a year. My judgment is so clear against it, that I would scarcely allow the attempt to be made, if the general in command should desire to make it. My last attempt upon Richmond was to get McClellan, when he was nearer there than the enemy was, to run in ahead of him. Since then I have constantly desired the Army of the Potomac, to make Lee's army, and not Richmond, it's objective point. If our army can not fall upon the enemy and hurt him where he is, it is plain to me it can gain nothing by attempting to follow him over a succession of intrenched lines into a fortified city. Yours truly A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADfS, DLC-RTL; LS, IHi. Meade's despatch to Halleck of 3 P.M., September 18, is as follows:</p>
<p>``I have reached such a position that I do not feel justified in making a further advance without some more positive authority than was contained in your last letter enclosing one from the President. If I apprehend rightly the views of the President and yourself it was to the effect that I might advance on Lee and threaten him with an attack and not permit him to cross the Rapidan without<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;468</span>
giving him battle. After accomplishing this my feint might be converted into a real attack if the development of the movement and subsequent information justified the same. It is precisely this question which now embarrasses me and which I desire to be advised upon. The situation is simply this---Lee in command of Ewells and Hills Corps estimated at not less than forty thousand Infantry occupies the south bank of the Rapidan with every available point covered with artillery and prepared to dispute the passage. The character of the south bank and its command forbids any attempt being made till Morton's ford is reached which is some ten miles below the Railroad. At this place the command is on this side and I think a passage can be forced but it would undoubtedly result in a considerable sacrifice and would also most certainly involve a general engagement immediately on crossing. Presuming for the discussion that the crossing was effected and the Enemy overcome he would probably fall back on Gordonsville, as I suppose his policy is to check and retard my advance as long and where he can. I do not deem it necessary to discuss the contingencies of a failure as they will of course present themselves to your mind. The whole question however in my judgement hangs upon the advantages to be gained and the course to be pursued in event of success. I am not in condition to follow Lee to Richmond and will be less so after being weakened by a severe battle. The only thing I could do would be to change my base to the Fredericksburg Rail Road and after taking a position in front of that place await an increase of force. The men I should have to sacrifice in the operation would be sufficient to secure the longer line of communication I now have. In fine I can get a battle out of Lee under very disadvantageous circumstances which may render his inferior force my superior and which is not likely to result in any very decided advantage, even in case I should be victorious. In this view I am reluctant to run the risks involved without the positive sanction of the Government. If any demonstration on the Peninsula were practicable or a force could threaten an advance on the Fredericksburg Road Lee would I think retire from my front but I take it for granted, either of these contingencies is out of the question.</p>

Sylvan County is intensely rebellious. I hoped to have been able to have accomplished one very important piece of work within forty eight hours but the receipt of your order will delay it but I do not for a moment doubt the wisdom of the order You may be sure I will use all possible dispatch in carrying it out. The news from Rosecrans is rather discouraging but I sincerely hope and believe that he will be able to hold his position until such reinforcements as you have ordered to him can arrive. Our cavalry under Genl. Shackelford, has been continually in contact with the enemy driving them all the time. Col [James P.

<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;471</span>Cleveland, both inclusive, it keeps all Tennessee clear of the enemy, and also breaks one of his most important Railroad lines. To prevent these consequences, is so vital to his cause, that he can not give up the effort to dislodge us from the position, thus bringing him to us, and saving us the labor, expence, and hazard of going further to find him; and also giving us the advantage of choosing our own ground, and preparing it, to fight him upon. The details must of course be left to Gen. Rosecrans, while we must furnish him the means to the utmost of our ability. If you concur, I think he would better be informed, that we are not pushing him beyond this position; and that, in fact, our judgment is rather against his going beyond it.

Hold the gaps of the North Carolina mountains, the line of the Holston River, or some point, if there be one, to prevent access from Virginia and connect with General Rosecrans, at least with your cavalry. The Secretary of War directs that you raise all the volunteers you can in East Tennessee. Select the officers, and if not commissioned by Governor Johnson they will be by the President.

<p>A Proclamation.</p>
<p>Whereas, in my Proclamation of the twenty-seventh of April, 1861, the ports of the States of Virginia and North Carolina, were, for reasons therein set forth, placed under blockade; and whereas the port of Alexandria, Virginia, has since been blockaded; but as the blockade of said port may now be safely relaxed with advantage to the interests of commerce:</p>
<p>Now, therefore, be it known, that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, pursuant to the authority in me vested by the fifth section of the act of Congress, approved on the 13th of July, 1861, entitled ``An act further to provide for the collection of duties on imports, and for other purposes,'' do hereby declare that the blockade of the said port of Alexandria, shall so far cease and determine, from and after this date, that commercial intercourse with said port, except as to persons, things, and information contraband of war, may, from this date, be carried on, subject to the laws of the United States, and to the limitations and in pursuance of the regulations which are prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury in his order which is appended to my proclamation of the 12th. of May, 1862.</p>
<p>In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>Yours of the 23rd. is just received, and it makes me doubt whether I am awake or dreaming. I have been struggling for ten days, first through Gen. Halleck, and then directly, to get you to go to assist Gen. Rosecrans in an extremity, and you have repeatedly<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;481</span>
declared you would do it, and yet you steadily move the contrary way. On the 19th. you telegraph once from Knoxville, and twice from Greenville, acknowledging receipt of order, and saying you will hurry support to Rosecrans. On the 20th. you telegraph again from Knoxville, saying you will do all you can, and are hurrying troops to Rosecrans. On the 21st. you telegraph from Morristown, saying you will hurry support to Rosecrans; and now your despatch of the 23rd. comes in from Carter's Station, still farther away from Rosecrans, still saying you will assist him, but giving no account of any progress made towards assisting him</p>
<p>You came in upon the Tennessee River at Kingston, Loudon, and Knoxville; and what bridges or the want of them upon the Holston, can have to do in getting the troops towards Rosecrans at Chattanooga is incomprehensible. They were already many miles nearer Chattanooga than any part of the Holston river is, and on the right side of it. If they are now on the wrong side of it, they can only have got so by going from the direction of Chattanooga, and that too, since you have assured us you would move to Chattanooga; while it would seem too, that they could re-cross the Holston, by whatever means they crossed it going East.</p>

My Dear General Rosecrans Washington, September 28, 1863.</div>
<p>We are sending you two small corps, one under General Howard, and one under General Slocum, and the whole under General Hooker. Unfortunately the relations between Generals Hooker and Slocum are not such as to promise good, if their present relative positions remain. Therefore let me beg,---almost enjoin upon you---that on their reaching you, you will make a transposition by which Gen. Slocum with his corps, may pass from under the command of Gen. Hooker, and Gen. Hooker, in turn, receive some other equal force. It is important for this to be done, though we could not well arrange it here. Please do it. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy, DLC-RTL. On September 25, General Henry W. Slocum telegraphed Lincoln, ``I have just been informed that I have again been placed under command of Maj Gen Jos. Hooker. My opinion of Gen Hooker both as an Officer &amp; a gentleman is too well known to make it necessary for me to refer to it in this communication. The public service cannot be promoted by placing under his command an Officer who has so little confidence in his ability as I have. Our relations are such that it would be degrading in me to accept any position under him. I have the honor therefore to respectfully tender the resignation of my commission as Maj Genl of volunteers'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>On October 12 Hooker telegraphed Lincoln from Stevenson, Alabama, suggesting that ``Gen'l Slocum may be tendered a command in Missouri, or somewhere else'' (DLC-RTL), and on October 13 Rosecrans replied to Lincoln's communication of September 28, that any attempt to mingle his troops with ``Potomac troops by placing them under Potomac Generals would kindle a flame . . . where, by care, and judgement, we shall soon have only a spirit of courageous emulation.'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>.). Slocum remained with the Eleventh and Twelfth Corps until April 4, 1864, when he was placed in command of the District of Vicksburg, Mississippi, under William T. Sherman's command (AGO <span class="rend-i">General Orders No</span>. 144, April 4, 1864).</p>

<p>As a matter of course, it will not be possible for me to make a response coextensive with the address which you have presented to<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;487</span>
me. If I were better known than I am, you would not need to be told that in the advocacy of the cause of temperance you have a friend and sympathizer in me. [Applause.]</p>
<p>When I was a young man, long ago, before the Sons of Temperance as an organization, had an existence, I in an humble way, made temperance speeches, [applause] and I think I may say that to this day I have never, by my example, belied what I then said. [Loud applause.]</p>
<p>In regard to the suggestions which you make for the purpose of the advancement of the cause of temperance in the army, I cannot make particular responses to them at this time. To prevent intemperance in the army is even a part of the articles of war. It is part of the law of the land---and was so, I presume, long ago---to dismiss officers for drunkenness. I am not sure that consistently with the public service, more can be done than has been done. All, therefore, that I can promise you is, (if you will be pleased to furnish me with a copy of your address) to have it submitted to the proper Department<span class="ptr"><a name="6_487_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_487_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> and have it considered, whether it contains any suggestions which will improve the cause of temperance and repress the cause of drunkenness in the army any better than it is already done. I can promise no more than that.</p>
<p>I think that the reasonable men of the world have long since agreed that intemperance is one of the greatest, if not the very greatest of all evils amongst mankind. That is not a matter of dispute, I believe. That the disease exists, and that it is a very great one is agreed upon by all.</p>
<p>The mode of cure is one about which there may be differences of opinion. You have suggested that in an army---our army---drunkenness is a great evil, and one which, while it exists to a very great extent, we cannot expect to overcome so entirely as to leave [have?] such successes in our arms as we might have without it. This undoubtedly is true, and while it is, perhaps, rather a bad source to derive comfort from, nevertheless, in a hard struggle, I do not know but what it is some consolation to be aware that there is some intemperance on the other side, too, and that they have no right to beat us in physical combat on that ground. [Laughter and applause.]</p>
<p>But I have already said more than I expected to be able to say when I began, and if you please to hand me a copy of your address it shall be considered. I thank you very heartily, gentlemen, for this call, and for bringing with you these very many pretty ladies.<span class="ptr"><a name="6_487_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_487_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span></p>

Gen. John M. Schofield Washington, D.C. Oct. 1. 1863.</div>
<p>There is no organized military force in avowed opposition to the general government, now in Missouri; and if any such shall reappear, your duty in regard to it will be too plain to require any special instruction. Still the condition of things, both there and elsewhere, is such as to render it indispensable to maintain for a time, the United States Military establishment in that State, as well as to rely upon it for a fair contribution of support to that establishment generally.</p>
<p>Your immediate duty, in regard to Missouri, now is to advance the efficiency of that establishment, and to so use it, as far as practicable, to compel the excited people there to leave one another alone.</p>
<p>Under your recent order, which I have approved, you will only arrest individuals, and suppress assemblies, or newspapers, when they may be working <span class="rend-i">palpable</span> injury<span class="ptr"><a name="6_492_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_492_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> to the Military in your charge; and, in no other case will you interfere with the expression of opinion in any form, or allow it to be interfered with violently by others. In this, you have a discretion to exercise with great caution, calmness, and forbearance.</p>
<p>With the matters of removing the inhabitants of certain counties <span class="rend-i">en masse</span>; and of removing certain individuals from time to time, who are supposed to be mischievous, I am not now interfering, but am leaving to your own discretion</p>
<p>Nor am I interfering with what may still seem to you to be necessary restrictions upon trade and intercourse.</p>
<p>I think proper, however, to enjoin upon you the following:</p>
<p>Allow no part of the Military under your command, to be engaged in either returning fugitive slaves, or in forcing, or enticing slaves from their homes; and, so far as practicable, enforce the same forbearance upon the people.</p>
<p>Report to me<span class="ptr"><a name="6_492_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_492_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> your opinion upon the availibility for good, of the enrolled militia of the State.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;493</span>Allow no one to enlist colored troops, except upon orders from you, or from here through you.</p>
<p>Allow no one to assume the functions of confiscating property, under the law of congress, or other wise, except upon orders from here.</p>
<p>At elections, see that those, and only those are allowed to vote, who are entitled to do so, by the laws of Missouri, including as of those laws, the restriction laid by the Missouri convention upon those who may have participated in the rebellion.</p>
<p>So far as practicable you will, by means of your military force, expel guerrillas, marauders, and murderers, and all who are known to harbor, aid, or abet them. But, in like manner, you will repress assumptions of unauthorized individuals to perform the same service; because under pretence of doing this, they become marauders and murderers themselves. To now restore peace, let the military obey orders; and those not of the military, leave each other alone; thus not breaking the peace themselves.</p>
<p>In giving the above directions, it is not intended to restrain you in other expedient and necessary matters not falling within their range. Your Obt. Servt. A LINCOLN</p>

<div class="opener">October 3, 1863</div>
<p>By the President of the United States of America.</p>
<p>A Proclamation.</p>
<p>The year that is drawing towards its close, has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature, that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever watchful providence of Almighty God. In the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to foreign States to invite and to provoke their aggression, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in the theatre of military conflict; while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union. Needful diversions of wealth and of strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defence, have not arrested the plough, the shuttle or the ship; the axe has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. Population has steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp, the siege and the battle-field; and the country, rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect continuance of years with large increase of freedom. No human counsel hath devised nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;497</span>
while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy. It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American People. I do therefore invite my fellow citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next, as a day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens. And I recommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to His tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty Hand to heal the wounds of the nation and to restore it as soon as may be consistent with the Divine purposes to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquillity and Union.</p>
<p>In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>
<p>[L.S.]</p>
<p>Done at the City of Washington, this Third day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States the Eighty-eighth. ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

<div class="opener">Hon. Charles D. Drake &amp; Executive Mansion<br>
others, Committee Washington D.C. Oct. 5. 1863</div>
<p>Gentlemen Your original address, presented on the 30th. ultimo, and the four supplementary ones, presented on the 3rd. inst have been carefully considered.</p>
<p>I hope you will regard the other duties claiming my attention, together with the great length and importance of these documents as constituting a sufficient apology for my not having responded sooner.</p>
<p>These papers, framed for a common object, consist of the things<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;500</span>
demanded, and the reasons for demanding them. The things demanded are:</p>
<p>First: That General Schofield shall be relieved, and General Butler be appointed, as commander of the Military Department of Missouri.</p>
<p>Second: That the system of Enrolled Militia in Missouri may be broken up, and national forces be substituted for it, and</p>
<p>Third: That at elections, persons may not be allowed to vote who are not entitled by law to do so.</p>
<p>Among the reasons given, enough of suffering and wrong to Union men is certainly, and I suppose truly stated. Yet the whole case, as presented, fails to convince me, that Gen. Schofield, or the Enrolled Militia, is responsible for that suffering and wrong. The whole can be explained on a more charitable, and, as I think, a more rational hypothesis. We are in civil war. In such cases there always is a main question; but in this case that question is a perplexing compound---Union and Slavery. It thus becomes a question not of two sides merely, but of at least four sides, even among those who are for the Union, saying nothing of those who are against it. Thus, those who are for the Union <span class="rend-i">with</span>, but not <span class="rend-i">without</span> slavery---those for it <span class="rend-i">without</span>, but not <span class="rend-i">with</span>---those for it <span class="rend-i">with</span> or <span class="rend-i">without</span>, but prefer it <span class="rend-i">with</span>---and those for it <span class="rend-i">with</span> or <span class="rend-i">without</span>, but prefer it <span class="rend-i">without</span>. Among these again, is a subdivision of those who are for <span class="rend-i">gradual</span> but not for <span class="rend-i">immediate</span>, and those who are for <span class="rend-i">immediate</span>, but not for <span class="rend-i">gradual</span> extinction of slavery. It is easy to conceive that all these shades of opinion, and even more, may be sincerely entertained by honest and truthful men. Yet, all being for the Union, by reason of these differences, each will prefer a different way of sustaining the Union. At once sincerity is questioned, and motives are assailed. Actual war coming, blood grows hot, and blood is spilled. Thought is forced from old channels into confusion. Deception breeds and thrives. Confidence dies, and universal suspicion reigns. Each man feels an impulse to kill his neighbor, lest he be first killed by him. Revenge and retaliation follow. And all this, as before said, may be among honest men only. But this is not all. Every foul bird comes abroad, and every dirty reptile rises up. These add crime to confusion. Strong measures, deemed indispensable but harsh at best, such men make worse by mal-administration. Murders for old grudges, and murders for pelf, proceed under any cloak that will best cover for the ocasion. These causes amply account for what has occurred in Missouri, without ascribing it to the weakness, or wickedness of any general. The newspaper files, those chroniclers of current events, will show that the evils<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;501</span>
now complained of were quite as prevalent under Fremont, Hunter, Halleck, and Curtis, as under Schofield. If the former had greater force opposed to them, they also had greater force with which to meet it. When the organized rebel army left the state, the main federal force had to go also, leaving the Department commander at home relatively no stronger than before. Without disparaging any, I affirm with confidence that no commander of that Department has, in proportion to his means, done better than Gen. Schofield.</p>
<p>The first specific charge against Gen. Schofield is that the Enrolled Militia was placed under his command, whereas it had not been placed under the command of Gen. Curtis. The fact I believe is true; but you do not point out, nor can I conceive, how that did, or could injure loyal men, or the Union cause.</p>
<p>You charge that upon Gen. Curtis being superseded by Gen. Schofield, Franklin A. Dick was superseded by James O. Brodhead, as Provost Marshal-General. No very specific showing is made as to how this did, or could injure the Union cause. It recalls, however, the condition of things, as presented to me, which led to a change of commander for that Department.</p>
<p>To restrain contraband intelligence and trade, a system of searches, seizures, permits, and passes, had been introduced, I think, by Gen. Fremont. When Gen. Halleck came, he found, and continued this system, and added an order applicable to some parts of the State, to levy and collect contributions from noted rebels, to compensate losses, and relieve destitution caused by the rebellion. The action of Gen. Fremont and Gen. Halleck, as stated, constituted a sort of system, which Gen. Curtis found in full operation when he took command of the Department. That there was a necessity for something of the sort was clear; but that it could only be justified by stern necessity, and that it was liable to great abuse in administration, was equally clear. Agents to execute it, contrary to the great Prayer, were led into temptation. Some might, while others would not resist that temptation. It was not possible to hold any to a very strict accountability; and those yielding to the temptation, would sell permits and passes to those who would pay most, and most readily for them; and would seize property, and collect levies in the aptest way to fill their own pockets. Money being the object, the man having money, whether loyal or disloyal, would be a victim. This practice doubtless existed to some extent, and it was a real additional evil, that it could be and was, plausably charged to exist in greater extent than it did.</p>
<p>When Gen. Curtis took command of the Department, Mr. Dick,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;502</span>
against whom I never knew anything to allege, had general charge of this system. A controversy in regard to it rapidly grew into almost unmanageable proportions. One side ignored the <span class="rend-i">necessity</span>, and magnified the evils of the system; while the other ignored the evils, and magnified the necessity; and each bitterly assailed the motives of the other. I could not fail to see that the controversy enlarged in the same proportion as the professed Union-men there distinctly took sides in two opposing political parties. I exhausted my wits, and very nearly my patience also, in efforts to convince both that the evils they charged on each other, were inherent in the case, and could not be cured by giving either party a victory over the other.</p>
<p>Plainly the irritating system was not to be perpetual; and it was plausably urged that it could be modified at once with advantage. The case could scarcely be worse, and whether it could be made better, could only be determined by a trial. In this view, and not to ban, or brand, Gen. Curtis, or to give a victory to any party, I made the change of commander for the Department. I now learn that soon after this change, Mr. Dick was removed, and that Mr. Brodhead, a gentleman of no less good character, was put in the place. The mere fact of this change is more distinctly complained of, than is any conduct of the new officer, or other consequence, of the change.</p>
<p>I gave the new commander no instructions as to the administration of the system mentioned, beyond what is contained in the private letter, afterwards surreptitiously published, in which I directed him to act solely for the public good, and independently of both parties. Neither anything you have presented me, nor anything I have otherwise learned, has convinced me that he has been unfaithful to this charge.</p>
<p>Imbecility is urged as one cause for removing Gen. Schofield; and the late massacre at Lawrence, Kansas, is pressed as evidence of that imbecility. To my mind that fact scarcely tends to prove the proposition. That massacre is only an example, of what Grierson,<span class="ptr"><a name="6_502_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_502_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> John Morgan, and many others, might have repeatedly done, on their respective raids, had they chose to incur the personal hazard, and possessed the fiendish hearts to do it.</p>
<p>The charge is made that Gen. Schofield, on purpose to protect the Lawrence murderers, would not allow them to be pursued into Missouri. While no punishment could be too sudden, or too severe for those murderers, I am well satisfied that the preventing of the threatened remedial raid into Missouri, was the only safe way to<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;503</span>
avoid an indiscriminate massacre there, including probably more innocent than guilty. Instead of condemning, I therefore approve what I understand Gen. Schofield did in that respect.</p>
<p>The charges that Gen. Schofield has purposely withheld protection from loyal people, and purposely facilitated the objects of the disloyal, are altogether beyond my power of belief. I do not arraign the veracity of gentlemen as to the facts complained of; but I do more than question the judgment which would infer that those facts occurred in accordance with the <span class="rend-i">purposes</span> of Gen. Schofield.</p>
<p>With my present views I must decline to remove Gen. Schofield. In this I decide nothing against Gen. Butler. I sincerely wish it were convenient to assign him a suitable command.</p>
<p>In order to meet some existing evils I have addressed a letter of instructions to Gen. Schofield, a copy of which I inclose to you.</p>
<p>As to the ``Enrolled Militia'' I shall endeavor to ascertain, better than I now know, what is it's exact value.</p>
<p>Let me say now, however, that your proposal to substitute national force for the ``Enrolled Militia'' implies that in your judgment the latter is doing something which needs to be done; and if so, the proposition to throw that force away, and to supply its place by bringing other forces from the field where they are urgently needed seems to me very extraordinary. Whence shall they come? Shall they be withdrawn from Banks, or Grant, or Steele, or Rosecrans? Few things have been so grateful to my anxious feeling as when, in June last, the local force in Missouri aided Gen. Schofield to so promptly send a large general force to the relief of Gen. Grant, then investing Vicksburg, and menaced from without by Gen. Johnston. Was this all wrong? Should the Enrolled Militia then have been broken up, and Gen. Herron<span class="ptr"><a name="6_503_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_503_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> kept from Grant, to police Missouri? So far from finding cause to object, I confess to a sympathy for whatever relieves our general force in Missouri, and allows it to serve elsewhere. I therefore, as at present advised, can not attempt the destruction of the Enrolled Militia of Missouri. I may add that the force being under the national military control, it is also within the proclamation in regard to the <span class="rend-i">Habeas Corpus</span>.</p>
<p>I concur in the propriety of your request in regard to elections, and have, as you see, directed Gen. Schofield accordingly.</p>
<p>I do not feel justified to enter upon the broad field you present in regard to the political differences between radicals and conservatives. From time to time I have done and said what appeared to me proper to do and say. The public knows it all. It obliges nobody to follow me, and I trust it obliges me to follow nobody. The<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;504</span>
radicals and conservatives, each agree with me in some things, and disagree in others. I could wish both to agree with me in all things; for then they would agree with each other, and would be too strong for any foe from any quarter. They, however, choose to do otherwise, and I do not question their right. I too shall do what seems to be my duty. I hold whoever commands in Missouri, or elsewhere, responsible to me, and not to either radicals or conservatives. It is my duty to hear all; but at last, I must, within my sphere, judge what to do, and what to forbear. Your Obt. Servt.</p>
<p>A. LINCOLN.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADfS, DLC-RTL. On September 30 delegations from Missouri and Kansas headed by Charles D. Drake waited upon the president to present a lengthy ``address'' alluding to various Radical conventions throughout Missouri which culminated in a state convention meeting in Jefferson City from which the delegation headed by Drake was appointed to visit Washington. All these conventions sustained the administration in the Emancipation Proclamation and the employment of Negro troops, but demanded immediate rather than gradual emancipation in Missouri, arraigned Governor Gamble, and demanded restoration of military control in Missouri. The substance of the nineteen-page ``address'' is so specifically covered in Lincoln's reply as to require no additional quotations.</p>
<p>Following presentation of the address, the conference continued for several hours. Lincoln's remarks as reported in the New York <span class="rend-i">Tribune</span> on October 1 are as follows:</p>
<p>``The President promised to consider carefully all the points urged, but left his auditory in doubt as to his intentions. He assured the delegation that he believed them to be the true friends of the Administration, whether the other `set,' not using the word `faction' this time, was so or not. As for Gen. Schofield, the President said that he had no reason to be dissatisfied with him, since he had not only obeyed orders, but had done so with unusual promptitude, had reenforced Grant, and sent troops elsewhere, when ordered to do so, without objection or delay. Thereupon Mr. Lincoln was asked whether, if he were satisfied that the removal of Schofield were the wish of the loyal people of Missouri and Kansas, he would remove him? The President answered that this circumstance, if proved beyond question, would go a great way with him. Of Gen. Butler, Mr. Lincoln said not a word. In the course of the interview, he remarked to the delegations, that their `set' was a little too fast for his policy, which favored gradual, rather than immediate emancipation in Missouri.'' A more complete report of this conference is given in John Hay's <span class="rend-i">Diary</span> and may be found in <span class="rend-i">Abraham Lincoln: A History</span> (VIII, 215-19).</p>
<p>Although the draft of Lincoln's reply is dated October 5, according to a Washington despatch of October 15 the communication was not sent until October 14: ``The President's reply to the address of the Missouri delegation, which was mailed to the Hon. C. D. Drake, Chairman . . . at St. Louis yesterday, will be published or not at the option of that gentleman. . . .'' (New York <span class="rend-i">Tribune</span>, October 17, 1863).</p>

<p>``Having been detailed by the Bureau of Ordnance, in conjunction with Major Laidley, U.S.A., to experiment with the material submitted by you as a substitute for common Gunpowder, I have been strongly impressed with its prospective value, and the results of experiments with the several specimens presented by you.</p>
<p>``As at first submitted, it was in too fine a state to be with safety and convenience transported; it was, therefore, made imperative that it should be grained. The small quantity submitted in that state appears to satisfy all the required conditions. If it retains its original properties, while conforming to these requirements, I think it will prove valuable. At any rate, the successful results already obtained, in my opinion, warrant a continuation of these experiments, and the manufacture of at least 500 lbs. that a definite opinion may be formed, after experiments of a more extended character than those hitherto made.''</p>

<div class="opener">October 17, 1863</div>
<p>By the President of the United States of America.</p>
<p>A Proclamation.</p>
<p>Whereas, The term of service of a part of the Volunteer forces of the United States will expire during the coming year, and whereas, in addition to the men raised by the present draft, it is deemed expedient to call out three hundred thousand volunteers to serve for three years or the war, not however exceeding three years.</p>
<p>Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy thereof, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into actual service, do issue this my Proclamation, calling upon the Governors of the different States to raise and have enlisted into the United States service, for the various companies and Regiments in the field from their respective States, their quotas of three hundred thousand men.</p>
<p>I further proclaim, that all volunteers thus called out and duly enlisted, shall receive advance pay, premium and bounty as heretofore communicated to the Governors of States by the War Department through the Provost Marshal General's Office by special letters.</p>
<p>I further proclaim, that all volunteers received under this call, as well as all others not heretofore credited, shall be duly credited on and deducted from the quotas established for the next draft.</p>
<p>I further proclaim, that if any State shall fail to raise the quota assigned to it by the War Department under this call, then a draft<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;524</span>
for the deficiency in said quota shall be made on said State or on the Districts of said State for their due proportion of said quota; and the said draft shall commence on the fifth day of January, 1864.</p>
<p>And I further proclaim, that nothing in this Proclamation shall interfere with existing orders, or those which may be issued for the present draft in the States where it is now in progress or where it has not yet commenced.</p>
<p>The quotas of the States and districts will be assigned by the War Department, through the Provost Marshal General's office, due regard being had for the men heretofore furnished whether by volunteering or drafting, and the recruiting will be conducted in accordance with such instructions as have been or may be issued by that Department.</p>
<p>In issuing this Proclamation, I address myself not only to the Governors of the several States, but also to the good and loyal people thereof, invoking them to lend their willing, cheerful and effective aid to the measures thus adopted, with a view to reinforce our victorious armies now in the field and bring our needful military operations to a prosperous end, thus closing forever the fountains of sedition and civil war.</p>
<p>In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>
<p>[L.S.]</p>
<p>Done at the City of Washington, this Seventeenth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States the eighty-eighth.</p>

<div class="opener">His Excellency Hamilton R. Gamble Executive Mansion.<br>
Governor of Missouri. Washington D.C. Oct. 19. 1863</div>
<p>Yours of the 1st. Inst. was duly received; and I have delayed so long to answer it, because of other pressing duties; because it did not appear to me that the domestic violence you apprehend, was very imminent; and because, if it were so imminent, my direction to Gen. Schofield embraces very nearly the extent of my power to repress it. Being instructed to repress all violence, of course he will, so far as in his power, repress any which may be offered to the State government.</p>
<p>At the beginning of our present troubles, the regularly installed State officers of Missouri, taking sides with the rebellion, were forced to give way to the provisional State government, at the head<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;527</span>
of which you stand and which was placed in authority, as I understood, by the unanamous action and acquiescence, of the Union people of the State. I have seen no occasion to make a distinction against that provisional government because of it's not having been chosen and inaugurated in the usual way. Nor have I seen any cause to suspect it of unfaithfulness to the Union. So far as I have yet considered, I am as ready, on a proper case made, to give the State the constitutional protection against invasion and domestic violence, under the provisional government, as I would be if it were under a government installed in the ordinary manner. I have not thought of making a distinction.</p>
<p>In your proclamation of the 12th. Inst. you state the proposition substantially, that no objection can be made to any change in the State government, which the people may desire to make, so far as the end can be effected by means conforming to the constitution and laws through the expression of the popular will; but that such change should not be effected by violence. I concur in this; and, I may add, that it makes precisely the distinction I wish to keep in view. In the absence of such violence, or imminent danger thereof, it is not proper for the national executive to interfere; and I am unwilling, by any formal, action, to show an appearance of belief that there is such imminent danger, before I really believe there is. I might thereby, to some extent, bear false witness.</p>
<p>You tell me ``a party has sprung up in Missouri, which openly and loudly proclaims the purpose to overturn the provisional government by violence.'' Does the party so proclaim, or is it only that, some members of the party so proclaim? If I mistake not, the party alluded to recently held a State convention, and adopted resolutions. Did they, therein declare violence against the provisional State government? No party can be justly held responsible for what individual members of it may say or do.</p>
<p>Nothing in this letter is written with reference to any State which may have maintained within it, no State government professedly loyal to the United States. Your Obt. Servt.</p>

<p>``The delegation from St. Mary's County have grossly misrepresented matters. Col. [William] Birney went under my orders to look for the site of a camp of instruction and rendezvous for colored troops. See his report, this day forwarded to the Adjutant General. He took with him a recruiting squad, who were stationed, each with an officer at Mill Stone, Spencers, Saint Leonards, Dukes, Forest Grove &amp; Benedict landings on the Patuxent. They are under special instructions, good discipline and have harmed no one.</p>
<p>``The only disorder or violence has been that two secessionists, named Southeron [John H. Sothoron and son] have killed second Lieut. White [Eben White, Seventh U.S. Colored Troops] at Benedict, but we hope to arrest the murderers. The officer was a white man. The only danger of confusion must be from the citizens, not the soldiers---but Col. Birney himself visited all the landings, talked with the citizens, and the only apprehension they expressed was that their slaves might leave them. It is a neighborhood of rabid secessionists. I beg that the President will not intervene and thus embolden them.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>

<p>Taking all our information together I think it probable that Ewell's corps has started for East Tennessee by way of Abingdon, marching last Monday, say, from Meade's front directly to the Railroad at Charlottesville. First, the object of Lee's recent movement against Meade, his destruction of the Alexandria &amp; Orange Rail road, and subsequent withdrawal, without more, not otherwise apparent, would be explained by this hypothesis. Secondly, the direct statement of Sharpe's man that Ewell has gone to Tennessee. Thirdly, the Irishman's statement that he has <span class="rend-i">not</span> gone through Richmond; and his further statement of an appeal made to the people at Richmond to go and protect their salt, which could only refer to the works near Abingdon. Fourthly, Graham's<span class="ptr"><a name="6_534_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_534_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> statement from Martinsburg that Imboden<span class="ptr"><a name="6_534_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln6?id=6_534_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> is in retreat for Harrisonburg. This last matches with the idea that Lee has retained his cavalry, sending Imboden, and perhaps other scraps, to join Ewell.</p>
<p>Upon this probability, what is to be done? If you have a plan matured, I have nothing to say. If you have not, then I suggest that with all possible expedition the Army of the Potomac get ready to attack Lee; and that, in the mean time, a raid shall, at all hazzards, break the Railroad at or near Lynchburg, Yours truly</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy, DLC-RTL. On October 23, General Meade forwarded to Halleck by telegraph a despatch which he had received from Colonel George H. Sharpe, deputy provost marshal at Alexandria, Virginia, as follows:</p>
<p>``Our men returned this morning. The old man says that Ewell's Corps went<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;535</span>
to Tennessee last Monday. He did not have time to go to the army himself but yesterday he saw a man from Fredericksburg who had gone up to Culpepper on Monday as claimant to get certificates for damages done to his property, &amp; citizens around Fredericksburg. These certificates were to come from Officers in Ewell's Corps. The claimant returned to Fredericksburg on Tuesday &amp; said that he was unable to complete his business because Ewell's Corps had left for Tennessee on Monday.</p>
<p>``This is the authority &amp; the old man thinks it straight.</p>
<p>``The old man also says that he is quite sure no troops have come to Lee's army, that it is reported that the Division at Petersburg has gone to reinforce Bragg &amp; that the main body of the enemy lies at Culpepper with some troops thrown over the Rapidan. The people about Fredericksburg report that Lee's late advance upon Meade's front has turned out disastrous, &amp; that A. P. Hill is in arrest for the failure. On the other hand one man brought with them, an Irish refugee from Richmond, who says he left there Wednesday morning at 7 o'clock, that up to that time Ewell's Corps had not passed through. That on Saturday evening last Gov [William] Smith addressed the citizens of Richmond urging the Home Co's. to go to protect the Salt works. He did not hear where but very few went; that Mr Davis returned from Bragg's army on Monday last &amp; addressed the citizens the same evening, assuring them of success in the West. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>Halleck telegraphed Meade at 11 A.M. on October 24, ``The President desires that you will prepare to attack Lee's army, and, at all hazards, make a cavalry raid, to break the railroad at or near Lynchburg, and such other places as may be practicable. . . . I send herewith a copy of the President's letter, just received.'' (OR, I, XXIX, II, 375).</p>
<p>Meade replied at 2 P.M., ``Your telegram . . . received. The information given by Colonel Sharpe's dispatch is disproved by two deserters just in, who report Ewell's corps in my immediate front. . . . From all the information I can get, Lee's army is now between the Rappahannock and the Rapidan, principally at Stevensburg, Brandy, and Jefferson. . . . I shall make every preparation with the utmost expedition to advance, and in the meantime select a cavalry command, and arrange the details for the raid ordered.''

<p>I can only say in this case, as in so many others, that I am profoundly grateful for the respect given in every variety of form in which it can be given from the religious bodies of the country. I saw, upon taking my position here, that I was going to have an administration, if an administration at all, of extraordinary difficulty. It was, without exception, a time of the greatest difficulty that this country ever saw. I was early brought to a living reflection that nothing in my power whatever, in others to rely upon, would succeed without the direct assistance of the Almighty, but all must fail.</p>
<p>I have often wished that I was a more devout man than I am.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;536</span>Nevertheless, amid the greatest difficulties of my Administration, when I could not see any other resort, I would place my whole reliance in God, knowing that all would go well, and that He would decide for the right.</p>
<p>I thank you, gentlemen, in the name of the religious bodies which you represent, and in the name of the Common Father, for this expression of your respect. I cannot say more.</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the Baltimore Synod: I can only say that in this case, as in many others, I am profoundly grateful for the support given me in every field of labor in which it can be given, and which has ever been extended to me by the religious community of the country. I saw before taking my position here that I was to have an administration, if it could be called such, of extraordinary difficulty, and it seems to me that it was ever present with me as an extraordinary matter that in the time of the greatest difficulty that this country had ever experienced, or was likely to experience, the man who, at the least of it, gave poor promise of ability, was brought out for duty at that time. I was early brought to the living reflection that there was nothing in the arms of this man, however there might be in others, to rely upon for such difficulties, and that without the direct assistance of the Almighty I was certain of failing. I sincerely wish that I was a more devoted man than I am. Sometimes in my difficulties I have been driven to the last resort to say God is still my only hope. It is still all the world to me.</p>
<p>I again say that I thank you in the name of the religious people of the country generally, and in the name of our common Father of returning you my thanks for the encouraging and most unanimous support that has been constantly given me. I know not that I can say more.</p>

Capt. James M. Cutts. Washington, Oct 26, 1863.</div>
<p>Although what I am now to say is to be, in form, a reprimand, it is not intended to add a pang to what you have already suffered upon the subject to which it relates. You have too much of life yet before you, and have shown too much of promise as an officer, for your future to be lightly surrendered. You were convicted of two offences. One of them, not of great enormity, and yet greatly to be avoided, I feel sure you are in no danger of repeating. The other you are not so well assured against. The advice of a father to his son ``Beware of entrance to a quarrel, but being in, bear it that the opposed may beware of thee,'' is good, and yet not the best. Quarrel not at all. No man resolved to make the most of himself, can spare time for personal contention. Still less can he afford to take all the consequences, including the vitiating of his temper, and the loss of self-control. Yield larger things to which you can show no more than equal right; and yield lesser ones, though clearly your own. Better give your path to a dog, than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog would not cure the bite.</p>
<p>In the mood indicated deal henceforth with your fellow men, and especially with your brother officers; and even the unpleasant events you are passing from will not have been profitless to you.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADf, DLC-RTL. This reprimand may have been delivered to Captain Cutts in a personal interview. Never published by Nicolay and Hay for obvious reasons, a portion was, however, incorporated in their footnote to Lincoln's letter to William G. Anderson, October 31, 1840, as an unidentified bit of advice ``given many years afterward to a young officer condemned to be court-martialed for quarreling'' (NH, I, 152).</p>
<p>The court-martial trial on June 30, 1863, of Captain James Madison Cutts, Jr., brother of Stephen A. Douglas' second wife, on the charge of ``conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman,'' involved three subordinate specifications: (1) that Cutts had used unbecoming language in addressing Captain Charles G. Hutton, aide-de-camp to General Burnside, when Hutton attempted to take over Cutts' desk; (2) that Cutts had sent a written communication to Major William Cutting derogatory to the accomplishments of Captain Hutton as an officer; and (3) that the said ``<span class="rend-i">James M. Cutts</span> . . . did, on or about the 10th day of April, 1863, while occupying room No. 79, Burnet House, Cincinnati, Ohio, on the afternoon of said day, attempt to look through the key-hole of room No. 80 of said house, occupied by a gentleman and his wife; and did, in<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;539</span>
the evening of said day, at about half past eleven o'clock, after said lady had retired to her room, and while her husband was in the corridor below, said lady being at the time partly undressed, previous to retiring, take a valise or portmanteau from his room and . . . placing himself thereon, did look through the Venetian blind or transom light in or over the door into said room and at said lady while undressing. . . .'' (AGO <span class="rend-i">General Orders No. 330</span>, October 8, 1863). To the first and second specifications Cutts pleaded not guilty; to the third, he acknowledged the facts ``with deep regret,'' and pleaded guilty. The court found him guilty on all three specifications and sentenced him to be dismissed from the service.</p>
<p>In connection with this episode, John Hay's <span class="rend-i">Diary</span> on July 18 records Lincoln's humorous remark that Cutts ``should be elevated to the peerage for it with the title of Count Peeper.'' Lincoln's pun and allusion were probably suggested by the name of the Swedish minister, Edward Count Piper.</p>
<p>Tried before the same court-martial, Captain Hutton was found guilty of having sent Captain Cutts a challenge to a duel, but was sentenced merely to a presidential reprimand. Major Cutting was found not guilty of the charge of having carried the challenge from Hutton to Cutts.</p>
<p>Lincoln approved the proceedings in the cases of Cutting and Cutts, but in view of Cutts' ``previous good character . . . and gallant conduct in battle'' remitted the sentence after reprimand. (<span class="rend-i">General Orders No. 330</span>). The proceedings in the case of Captain Hutton, Lincoln disapproved, because ``The penalty fixed by the 25th Article of War for the offence of which the accused is found guilty, viz., sending a challenge to another officer, is cashiering, and admits of no alternative. . . . The President directs that Captain Hutton be dismissed the service of the United States from the 28th day of September, 1863.'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>.). Hutton was reappointed, however, as of October 30, 1863, and served throughout the war.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADfS, DLC-RTL. On October 11, 1863, Mrs. D. P. Livermore of the Chicago Sanitary Commission wrote Lincoln:</p>
<p>``The patriotic women of the Northwestern States will hold a grand Fair in Chicago, on the last week of Oct., and the first of Nov., to raise funds for the Sanitary Commission of the Northwest, whose head-quarters are in Chicago. This Commission labors especially for the sick and wounded soldiers of the</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;540</span>South western States, of whose bravery, and persistent endurance, we are all justly proud. I enclose you circulars, which will explain to you our entire plan, and show you the magnitude of the enterprise, by which we confidently hope to realize from $25,000 to $50,000.</p>
<p>``The greatest enthusiasm prevails. . . . Artists . . . are painting pictures for it, manufacturers are making elegant specimens of their handiwork for the occasion, tradesmen are donating the choicest of their wares, while women are surpassing their ordinary ingenuity and taste in devising beautiful articles for sale, or decorations for the walls of the four spacious halls we are to occupy.</p>
<p>``The Executive Committee have been urgently requested to solicit from Mrs. Lincoln and yourself some donation to this great Fair---not so much for the value of the gift, as for the eclat which this circumstance would give to the Fair. It has been suggested to us from various quarters that the most acceptable donation you could possibly make, would be <span class="rend-i">the original manuscript of the Proclamation of emancipation</span>. . . . if it is at all consistent with what is proper, for you to donate it. There would be great competition among buyers to obtain possession of it, and to say nothing of the interest that would attach to such a gift, it would prove pecuniarily of great value. We should take pains to have such an arrangement made as would place the document permanently in either the State or the Chicago Historical Society.</p>
<p>``There would seem great appropriateness in this gift to Chicago, or Illinois, for the benefit of our Western soldiers, coming as it would from a Western President. We hope it may be possible for you to donate it to us.</p>
<p>``But if it be not possible, then allow us to ask for some other simple gift---from Mrs. Lincoln and yourself---sufficient to show that you are cognizant of our efforts. . . . Our Fair opens on Tuesday, Oct. 27th. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>On October 21, Isaac N. Arnold telegraphed, ``I am desired by the ladies having charge of the North western fair to remind of it &amp; beg you will send the original of proclamation of Freedom if possible. Answer to U.S. San Com Here.'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>.).</p>

to let some of your confidential friends know your wishes . . . I have a recent letter from Hon. Thompson Campbell . . . one of the most effective and vigorous champions of our cause in California, before the late election, and is a member of the Legislature from San Francisco. Speaking of the Presidential candidate, he says: `If he wishes the nomination, I am clearly for your friend, Mr. Lincoln.' He says he consented to go into the Legislature for the purpose of being better able to shape things in regard to the delegates to the National Convention next year. He says further, and it is well to heed it, that if he be not greatly mistaken, the whole patronage of the Government in California, will be wielded against you next summer. Campbell has done more to sustain your administration for the last six months, than all the office-holders in the State put together, and if he only knew your wishes and views I think he can be relied upon for an equally efficient service hereafter.</p>

His business imperatively requires his presence at home for a short time, and I think . . . his request is not unreasonable. A longer leave than twenty days must be granted by Genl. Halleck. Twenty days would not more than enable him to get home from where he now is.

<div class="textindentlevelx">
<div class="opener">[October 27, 1863]</div>
<p>In June last a Division was substantially lost at, and near Winchester, Va. At the time it was under Gen. Milroy as immediate commander in the field Gen. Schenck as Department commander at Baltimore and Gen. Halleck as General-in-Chief at Washington. Gen. Milroy, as immediate commander, was put in arrest, and subsequently a Court of Inquiry examined, chiefly with reference to disobedience of orders, and reported the evidence. The foregoing is a synoptical statement of the evidence, together with the Judge Advocate General's conclusions. The disaster, when it came, was a surprize to all. It was very well known to Gen. Schenck and Gen. Milroy for some time before that Gen. Halleck thought the division was in general danger of a surprize at Winchester, that it was of<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;542</span>
no service there commensurate with the risk it incurred, and that it ought to be withdrawn; but although he more than once advised it's withdrawal he never positively ordered it. Gen. Schenck, on the contrary, believed the service of the force at Winchester, was worth the hazard, and so did not positively order it's withdrawal, until it was so late that the enemy cut the wire and prevented to [<span class="rend-i">sic</span>] order reaching Gen. Milroy. Gen. Milroy seems to have concurred with Gen. Schenck in the opinion that the force should be kept at Winchester at least till the approach of danger, but he disobeyed no order upon the subject. Some question can be made whether some of Gen. Halleck's despatches to Gen. Schenck, should not have been construed to be orders to withdraw the force, and obeyed accordingly; but no such question can be made against Gen. Milroy. In fact the last order he received, was to be prepared to withdraw, but not to actually withdraw till further order, which further order never reached him. Serious blame is not necessarily due to every serious disaster, and I can not say that in this case, any of their officers is deserving of serious blame. No Court-Martial is deemed necessary or proper in the case.</p>

<p>A majority of these are shown to have been in the rebel service. I believe it could be shown that this government here have deliberately armed more than ten times as many, captured at Gettysburg, to say nothing of similar operations in East Tennessee. These papers contain, altogether, thirty one manuscript pages, and one newspaper in extenso; and yet I do not find it any where charged in them, that any loyal man has been harmed by reason of being disarmed, or that any disloyal one has harmed any body by reason of being armed by the Federal or State government. Of course I have not had time to carefully examine all; but I have had most of them examined and briefed by others, and the result is as stated. The remarkable fact, that the actual evil is yet only anticipated---inferred---induces me to suppose I understand the case. But I do not state my impression, because I might be mistaken; and because your duty and mine is plain in any event. The locality of nearly all this, seems to be St. Joseph, and Buchanan County. I wish you to give special attention to this region, particularly on election day. Prevent violence from whatever quarter; and see that the soldiers themselves, do no wrong. Yours truly A. LINCOLN</p>

He has, in no form, announced anything recently in regard to troops in New-York, except in his letter to Governor Seymour of October 21st. which has been published in the newspapers of that State. It has not been announced nor decided, in any form, by the Provost Marshal-General, or any one else in authority of the government, that every citizen who has paid his three hundred dollars commutation, is liable to be immediately drafted again, or that towns that have just raised the money to pay their quotas will have again to be subject to similar taxation or suffer the operation of<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;552</span>
the new conscription, nor is it probable that the like of these ever will be announced or decided.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; AD, DLC-RTL. This memorandum provided the substance of a telegram from John Hay to Abram Wakeman of this date in reply to a telegram from Simon Hanscom to Hay, received at 2:45 P.M. as follows: ``Dean Richmond Chairman Democratic State Committee has distributed a circular over State announcing the Pro Mar Genl Fry claims in Proclamation that this State still owes forty seven thousand six hundred (47600) men under draft just completed &amp; that every citizen who has paid his three hundred (300) dollars commutation is liable to be immediately drafted again &amp; that towns that have just raised the money to pay their quotas will have again to be subject to similar taxation or suffer the operation of the new conscription. The effect of this is bad. I am requested by Post Master Wakeman to ascertain by Telegraph the proper answer to make to this which must be done immediately. Will you please ask Mr. L &amp; give me the fact in a nutshell by Telegraph soon as possible.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>On this telegram James B. Fry endorsed: ``I made in a letter to Gov. Seymour a full statement of his quota under the call for 300 thousand, and then told him what his quota was for the present (current) draft, and how many men had been held up to the date of my letter, and how their amount of men stood <span class="rend-i">up to that date</span>. The draft is still going on as is volunteering &amp; the deficiency or credit for next draft if another is necessary cannot be foretold. Governor Seymour has published that letter.

My dear Sir. Washington, Nov. 2. 1863.</div>
<p>Some days ago I understood you to say that your brother, Gen. Frank Blair, desires to be guided by my wishes as to whether he will occupy his seat in congress or remain in the field. My wish,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;555</span>
then, is compounded of what I believe will be best for the country, and best for him. And it is, that he will come here, put his military commission in my hands, take his seat, go into caucus with our friends, abide the nominations, help elect the nominees, and thus aid to organize a House of Representatives which will really support the government in the war. If the result shall be the election of himself as Speaker, let him serve in that position; if not, let him re-take his commission, and return to the Army. For the country this will heal a dangerous schism; for him, it will relieve from a dangerous position. By a misunderstanding, as I think, he is in danger of being permanently separated from those with whom only he can ever have a real sympathy---the sincere opponents of slavery. It will be a mistake if he shall allow the provocations offered him by insincere time-servers, to drive him out of the house of his own building. He is young yet. He has abundant talent---quite enough to occupy all his time, without devoting any to temper. He is rising in military skill and usefulness. His recent appointment to the command of a corps, by one so competent to judge as Gen. Sherman, proves this. In that line he can serve both the country and himself more profitably than he could as a member of congress on the floor. The foregoing is what I would say, if Frank Blair were my brother instead of yours. Yours very truly</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS, RPB. The text of this telegram was also incorporated in Lincoln's letter, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>. On October 27, General Robert C. Schenck issued his <span class="rend-i">General Orders No. 58</span>, instructing provost marshals (1) to arrest all persons ``who have been engaged in rebellion . . . or have given aid and comfort or encouragement to others so engaged'' if ``found at, or hanging about, or approaching any poll. . . .''; (2) to require an oath of allegiance ``of any one whose vote may be challenged on the ground that he is not loyal. . . .''; (3) to ``report . . . any Judge of an election who, shall refuse his aid in carrying out this order . . . or who, . . . shall refuse to require the oath of allegiance. . . .''</p>
<p>On October 31, Governor Bradford wrote Lincoln:</p>
<p>``Rumors are today current . . . that detachments of soldiers are to be dispatched on Monday next to several of the counties of the State with the view of being present at their Polls on Wednesday next, the day of our State Election. These troops are not residents of the State and consequently are not sent for the purpose of voting, and as there is no reason in my opinion to apprehend any riotous or violent proceedings at the Election, the inference is unavoidable that these Military detachments if sent are expected to exert some control . . . in that Election. I am also informed that orders are to be issued from this Military Department on Monday presenting certain restrictions . . . in the right of suffrage. . . .</p>
<p>``From my knowledge of your sentiments on these subjects as expressed to Hon R Johnson in my presence on 22d Inst, as also disclosed in your letter of instructions to Genl. Schofield since published, in referrence to the Missouri Election, I can not but think that the orders above referred to are without your personal knowledge. . . . I can not but feel that to suffer any Military interference in the matter of our Election, or to prescribe any test oath to voters, when all the Candidates . . . with the exception perhaps of two or three in one Congressional District, are all loyal men, would be justly obnoxious to the public sentiment of the State . . . would appear as an offensive discrimination against our State. Our citizens are aware that highly important Elections have recently taken place in other States, without . . . any such interference . . . with no limit upon the Elective franchise other than the State laws prescribe, and where one at least of the Candidates so supported was considered so hostile to the Government that for months past he has been banished from the County, certainly any such interference as between the loyal men now candidates in this State would under such compassions, be more justly objectionable and find nothing in the present condition of things here to justify it.</p>

<div class="opener">His Excellency A. W. Bradford Executive Mansion.<br>
Governor of Maryland. Washington, Nov. 2. 1863.</div>
<p>Sir: Yours of the 31st. ult. was received yesterday about noon, and since then I have been giving most earnest attention to the subject matter of it. At my call Gen. Schenck has attended; and he assures me it is almost certain that violence will be used at some of the voting places on election day, unless prevented by his provostguards. He says that at some of those places Union voters will not attend at all, or run a ticket unless they have some assurance of<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;557</span>
protection. This makes the Missouri case, of my action in regard to which, you express your approval. The remaining point of your letter is a protest against any person offering to vote being put to any test not found in the laws of Maryland. This brings us to a difference between Missouri and Maryland. With the same reason in both States, Missouri has, by law, provided a test for the voter, with reference to the present rebellion, while Maryland has not. For example, Gen. Tremble, captured fighting us at Gettysburg, is, without recanting his treason, a legal voter by the laws of Maryland. Even Gen. Schenck's order, admits him to vote, if he recants upon oath. I think that is cheap enough. My order in Missouri, which you approve, and Gen. Schenck's order here, reach precisely the same end. Each assures the right of voting to all loyal men; and whether a man <span class="rend-i">is</span> loyal, each allows that man to fix by his own oath. Your suggestion that nearly all the candidates are loyal, I do not think quite meets the case. In this struggle for the nation's life, I can not so confidently rely on those whose elections may have depended upon disloyal votes. Such men, when elected, may prove true; but such votes are given them in the expectation that they will prove false.</p>
<p>Nor do I think that to keep the peace at the polls, and to prevent the persistently disloyal from voting, constitutes just cause of offence to Maryland. I think she has her own example for it. If I mistake not, it is precisely what Gen. Dix did when your Excellency was elected Governor.</p>
<p>I revoke the first of the three propositions in Gen. Schenck's general order No. 53; not that it is wrong in principle, but because the military being, of necessity, exclusive judges as to who shall be arrested, the provision is too liable to abuse. For the revoked part I substitute the following:</p>
<p>``That all Provost Marshals, and other Military officers, do prevent all disturbance and violence at or about the polls, whether offered by such persons as above described, or by any other person, or persons whomsoever''</p>
<p>The other two propositions of the order I allow to stand.</p>
<p>Gen. Schenck is fully determined, and has my strict orders besides, that all loyal men may vote, and vote for whom they please.</p>
<p>Your Obt. Servt A. LINCOLN.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADfS, DLC-RTL; LS, MdAA. On November 3, Governor Bradford answered Lincoln:</p>
<p>``Your letter of 2nd inst. in reply to mine of 31st ulto. reached me to-day after I had already read it in the Baltimore papers of this morning.</p>
<p>``Your Excellency has in this respect the advantage of me, for although, following your example, I shall send a duplicate of this to the Press, the probabilities<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;558</span>
are, looking to recent events, that the military authorities will not allow its publication.</p>
<p>``When I wrote to you on Saturday last I had not been able to procure a Copy of the Military Order in reference to the Election and acted merely on the rumor of its character. When I saw it, as I did for the first time on Sunday I found it even more objectionable . . . and when I was shown on the same day a copy of your letter to Mr. Swann, in which you say you `trust there is no just ground for the suspicion' he had expressed and declaring that you felt (mortified that there could be a doubt upon this point of your (his) enquiry' &amp;c., which point was a suggestion by Mr. Swann, that `the election about to take place will be attended with undue interference on the part of persons claiming to represent the wishes of the Government.' I rested satisfied that I should receive from you a prompt countermand of the Order in question. If the sending out one or more Regiments of troops distributed among several of the Counties to attend their places of Elections in defiance of the well known laws of the State prohibiting their presence; ordering Military Officers and Provost Marshals to arrest voters guilty, in the opinion of such officers, of certain offences; menacing Judges of Election with the power of the Military arm in case this Military order was not respected, is not an `undue' interference with the freedom of elections, I confess myself, unable to imagine what is.</p>
<p>``The purport of your Excellency's remarks in your letter to me is confined chiefly to a justification of the exclusion of disloyal voters from the Polls by means of the administration of an oath of allegiance; without stopping to analyse the particular oath in question it may be sufficient to say that this clause of the Order is by far the least objectionable of the three. If any who were once citizens of the United States have been guilty of such conduct as justly disfranchises them, let them take the consequences . . . But I insist that the Judges whom the State has provided are the exclusive Judges of the question of such citizenship and that they shall be allowed to exercise their own judgment upon that question, and I shall never cease to protest against any attempt of the Military power in a loyal State to control that judgment and especially against the use of any threats tending to coerce. . . .</p>
<p>``The first and third Sections of the Order are the most remarkable items of the arbitrary authority it assumes. . . .</p>
<p>``I am aware that your Excellency has so far modified the first of said Sections, . . . but . . . whilst the modification may relieve that part of the order of some of the most immoderate of its powers it still leaves these Officers the exclusive judges of who are guilty of violence or disturbances . . . opportunity for . . . abuse of power,---the probabilities of which you may the more readily estimate when I inform you that several of them are themselves candidates for some of our most important offices. . . .''

<p>I select you to make the test of the new gun-powder, according to the foregoing documents. Having expended some five thousand<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;560</span>
dollars to be prepared for making the test, it is desired that it be most carefully and thoroughly made, and answers thereupon given to all the following questions, and any others which may occur to you as pertinent.</p>
<p>Does this powder contain saltpetre or sulphur?</p>
<p>Does it bear any relation to gun-cotten?</p>
<p>Can the ingredients for making it always be obtained in sufficient quantity in the United States?</p>
<p>Is it's manufacture simple, requiring no complicated apparatus, and is it attended with less danger than the manufacture of ordinary gun-powder?</p>
<p>Do atmospheric changes, whether of moisture or heat, injure the powder?</p>
<p>Will it explode with as little or less pressure than ordinary gun-powder?</p>
<p>Will it ignite under 300deg.. Celsius?</p>
<p>Will it ignite by a spark, or percussion-cap, like common gun-powder?</p>
<p>Are <span class="rend-i">seven</span> parts of it, in weight, as effective in smooth bored guns as <span class="rend-i">nine</span> parts of common gun-powder?</p>
<p>Is <span class="rend-i">one</span> part of it, in weight, as effective in rifled guns, as <span class="rend-i">two</span> parts of common powder?</p>
<p>Will it, or the ingredients of it, deteriorate in store?</p>
<p>Will it heat a gun less than common powder? and in what proportion?</p>
<p>Does it give a weaker report?</p>
<p>Does it make less smoke?</p>
<p>Does it foul a gun less?</p>
<p>Is it less liable to burst or damage a gun?</p>
<p>In proportion to effect produced, is it cheaper than common gun-powder?</p>
<p>Has it any fault or faults not stated, or suggested in and by the answers to the foregoing questions? and if so, what?</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADf, DLC-RTL. See Lincoln to Isaac R. Diller, December 15, 1862, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>. As cataloged in the Lincoln Papers, this undated memorandum is assigned the date ``[November?, 1862]'' but a notation ``Apr. 4 1863(?) (Evidently to Dr. [Charles M] Wetherill)'' appears on the first page, not in Lincoln's handwriting. Lincoln's reference to the amount of $5,000, however, definitely places this memorandum after his memorandum to Stanton and Welles of July 21, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>. A letter from Diller dated November 2, 1863, reads as follows:</p>
<p>``I have the honor to enclose, at your request, a true copy of the agreement entered into between your Excellency and myself, on the 15th. of December, 1862, respecting a new article of gun powder.</p>
<p>``I very respectfully beg leave to inform you, that I have delivered to Major T. T. S. Laidley, U.S.A. at the Frankford Arsenal, Penna. the <span class="rend-i">maximum</span><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;561</span>
amount of powder as specified in the within agreement, and have the honor to request that a board of `officers, or other skilled person or persons' may be selected by your Excellency to test the same, according to the terms of the agreement, before mentioned.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>Thus Lincoln's memorandum, which follows closely the specification given by Diller on December 10, 1862 (see note to Lincoln's letter to Diller, December 15, 1862), would seem to have been meant for the board of ``officers, or other skilled person or persons'' who were to test the powder.</p>
<p>See also Lincoln to Diller, November 7, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>.</p>
<p>On December 14, Diller wrote from Virden, Illinois, that he was awaiting orders, and that if the government did not intend to do anything about the manufacture of the powder, he would want to patent it. John Hay endorsed the letter, ``Ansd. Dec. 26. The Prest. declines appn'g a new Board Mr D. has permission to patent his invention. The Prest. sends his best wishes for success.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
