<p>[<span class="rend-i">Daily Courant</span> Version]</p>
<p>Whether we will have it so or not, the slave question is the prevailing question before the nation. Though it may be true, and probably <span class="rend-i">is</span> true, that all parties, factions and individuals desire it should be settled, it still goes on unsettled---the all-prevailing and all-pervading question of the day. Hardly any other great question, however important it may have appeared, has been before the country several years, that had the power so to excite the public mind as this question of slavery. It has been so for six years, and before this received considerable consideration. It is in reality, older. It was rife before the Revolution, even. But it was settled, apparently. It has been settled many times; but each time it has risen it has come higher and higher. It has been coming up and going down. Its last rise was in January, 1854; it rose then higher than any former time, but this has never subsided. Otherwise than this, it grows more and more in magnitude and importance.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I said in a speech in Illinois, ``We are now in the fifth year of an inauguration of a policy which was to settle this question satisfactorily, but we have not seen the end.'' It may now be added that since the winter of 1857-8, when the Lecompton imbroglio was created, those who then brought up the question have never been able to see the end. It characterized all the speeches, that the policy they had adopted ``was working well, and we were just at the end of it, notwithstanding the efforts of Abolitionists to continue it along. We are just getting rid of this vexed question; and the tail of this hideous creature is just going out of sight.''</p>
<p>Now we hear no more of this; and the question arises, ``Why can't this question which we all desire so much to be settled, be satisfactorily arranged?'' The reason is, that while we all agree that we want it settled, one faction wants to settle it one way, a second has a different plan, and a third still another. Each pulls in a different direction. All desire its settlement, but differ in the method of doing it; and none of them being in a decided majority have ever been able to accomplish the object.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;3</span>I think one great mistake is made by them all. I think our wisest men have made this mistake. They underrate its importance, and a settlement can never be effected until its magnitude is properly estimated. Until we do this, the means of settlement will never be properly estimated. Now what is the difficulty? One-sixth of the population of the United States is slave. One-sixth of the population of the United States is slave. One man of every six, one woman of every six, one child of every six, is a slave. Those who own them look upon them as property, and nothing else. They contemplate them as property, and speak of them as such. The slaves have the same ``property quality,'' in the minds of their owners, as any other property. The entire value of the slave population of the United States, is, at a moderate estimate, not less than $2,000,000,000. This amount of <span class="rend-i">property</span> has a vast influence upon the minds of those who own it. The same amount of property owned by Northern men has the same influence upon <span class="rend-i">their</span> minds. In this we do not assume that we are better than the people of the South---neither do we admit that they are better than we. We are not better, barring circumstances, than they. Public opinion is formed relative to a property basis. Therefore, the slaveholders battle any policy which depreciates their slaves as property. What increases the value of this property, they favor. When you tell them that slavery is immoral, they rebel, because they do not like to be told they are interested in an institution which is not a moral one. When you enter into a defence of slavery, they seize upon it, for they like justification. The result is, that public opinion is formed among them which insists upon the encouragement or protection, the enlargement or perpetuation of slavery---and secures them property in the slave.</p>
<p>Now this comes in conflict with this proposition that we at the North view slavery as a wrong. We understand that the ``equality of man'' principle which actuated our forefathers in the establishment of the government is right; and that slavery, being directly opposed to this, is morally wrong. I think that if anything can be proved by natural theology, it is that slavery is morally wrong. God gave man a mouth to receive bread, hands to feed it, and his hand has a right to carry bread to his mouth without controversy.</p>
<p>We suppose slavery is wrong, and that it endangers the perpetuity of the Union. Nothing else menaces it. Its effect on free labor makes it what Seward has been so roundly abused for calling, an irrepressible conflict. Almost every man has a sense of certain things being wrong, and at the same time, a sense of its pecuniary value. These conflict in the mind, and make a riddle of a man. If slavery is considered upon a property basis, public opinion must<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;4</span>
be forced to its support. The alternative is its settlement upon the basis of its being wrong. Some men think it is a question of neither right or wrong; that it is a question of dollars and cents, only; that the Almighty has drawn a line across the country, south of which the land is always to be cultivated by slave labor; when the question is between the white man and the nigger, they go in for the white man; when it is between the nigger and the crocodile, they take sides with the nigger. There is effort to make this feeling of indifference prevalent the country, and this is one of the things, perhaps, that prevents the sudden settlement of the question. Is it possible that a national policy can be sustained because nobody opposes or favors it? It may answer to serve the ends of politicians for a while, but it falls at last. There may be one way, however, to make it stand, and that is to make the opinion of the people conform to it; must be made to conclude that those who want slavery shall have it, and that it is simply a matter of dollars and cents. I do not believe a majority of the people of this nation can be made to take this view of it.</p>
<p>Is there any man of the Democratic party, especially the ``Douglas wing,'' but will say that in his opinion the Declaration of Independence has no application to the negro? I have asked this question many times during the past three years, and no Democrat has yet denied that this was his belief, though I have asked it always where people are in the habit of answering their speakers when they please. So I assume this to be their belief to-day; and I tell you, you are safe to offer a premium to any man who will show you a Democrat who said so five years ago. I avow I never heard it from any man until I heard it from the lips of Judge Douglas. I had, to be sure, in certain portions of the country, heard men say something to this effect, but they didn't sneak around it with any statement like this. <span class="rend-i">They</span> took the bull by the horns, and said the Declaration of Independence wasn't true! Judge Taney might have first broached the doctrine. Perhaps he did; but I heard it first from Judge Douglas, though it was after Taney's Dred Scott decision. If so, Douglas possibly got it from him. Here's half the people of this nation saying what they would not have said five years ago; taking man from his kind and placing him among the brutes. This is a long stride towards bringing about this feeling of indifference in the minds of the people of this country. One more such stride and the object would be reached.</p>
<p>The proposition that there is a struggle between the white man and the negro contains a falsehood. There is <span class="rend-i">no</span> struggle between them. It assumes that unless the white man enslaves the negro, the<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;5</span>
negro will enslave the white man. In that case, I think I would go for enslaving the black man, in preference to being enslaved myself. As the learned Judge of a certain Court is said to have decided---``When a ship is wrecked at sea, and two men seize upon one plank which is capable of sustaining but one of them, either of them can rightfully push the other off!'' There is, however, no such controversy here. They say that between the nigger and the crocodile they go for the nigger. The proportion, therefore, is, that as the crocodile to the nigger so is the nigger to the white man.</p>
<p>They tell us that they desire the people of a territory to vote slavery out or in as they please. But who will form the opinion of the people there? The territories may be settled by emigrants from the free States, who will go there with this feeling of indifference. The question arises, ``slavery or freedom?'' Caring nothing about it, they let it come in, and that is the end of it. It is the surest way of nationalizing the institution. Just as certain, but more dangerous because more insidious; but it is leading us there just as certainly and as surely as Jeff. Davis himself would have us go.</p>
<p>If, then, we of the Republican party who think slavery is a wrong, and would mould public opinion to the fact that it is wrong, should get the control of the general government, I do not say we would or should meddle with it where it exists; but we could inaugurate a policy which would treat it as a wrong, and prevent its extension.</p>
<p>For instance, out in the street, or in the field, or on the prairie I find a rattlesnake. I take a stake and kill him. Everybody would applaud the act and say I did right. But suppose the snake was in a bed where children were sleeping. Would I do right to strike him there? I might hurt the children; or I might not kill, but only arouse and exasperate the snake, and he might bite the children. Thus, by meddling with him here, I would do more hurt than good. Slavery is like this. We dare not strike at it where it is. The manner in which our constitution is framed constrains us from making war upon it where it already exists. The question that we now have to deal with is, ``Shall we be acting right to take this snake and carry it to a bed where there are children?'' The Republican party insists upon keeping it out of the bed.</p>
<p>Again: I met Mr. Cassius M. Clay in the cars at New Haven one day last week, and it was my first opportunity to take him by the hand. There was an old gentleman in the car, seated in front of us, whose coat collar was turned far down upon the shoulders. I saw directly that he had a large wen on his neck. I said to Mr. Clay, That wen represents slavery; it bears the same relation<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;6</span>
to that man that slavery does to the country. That wen is a great evil; the man that bears it will say so. But he does not dare to cut it out. He bleeds to death if he does, directly. If he does <span class="rend-i">not</span> cut it out; it will shorten his life materially.</p>
<p>This is only applicable to men who think slavery is wrong. Those who think it right, of course will look upon the rattlesnake as a jewel, and call the wen an ornament. I suppose the only way to get rid of it is, for those who think it wrong, to work together, and to vote no longer with the Democracy who love it so well.</p>
<p>Do you who think slavery is wrong, but still vote with the Democracy, act towards it as you do towards any other thing you consider wrong? I think not; on the contrary, you find fault with those who denounce it. In your view of the case it must not be discussed at all. In your view it must not be spoken of in the free States, because slavery is <span class="rend-i">not</span> there; nor in the slave States, because it <span class="rend-i">is</span> there; you do not want it brought into politics because it stirs up agitation; you do not want to hear of it from the pulpit because it is not religion; you do not want to take it into your Tract Societies because it creates disturbance <span class="rend-i">there</span>.</p>
<p>Are you consistent in this? You say that if the South themselves desire to stir the question, you wish them God-speed in it. Are you certain of that? In 1858 Frank P. Blair of Missouri did just this thing for his State. He went into the fight, and was a candidate for Congress. He was beaten; and when you heard of his defeat did you hang your heads in sorrow? I <span class="rend-i">reckon</span> not! I <span class="rend-i">guess</span>, that you threw your hat into the air and shouted, ``Hurrah! for Democracy!'' (Mr. Lincoln then proceeded to speak of the provision in the constitution which permitted the slave trade to continue 20 years. Although it was not expressly so stated, it was understood by the framers of that instrument that it was to have been abolished at the end of that time. He argued that if they had not considered slavery a wrong, they would not have thus limited the time of supply.) He continued:</p>
<p>I think the Democracy are pretty generally getting into a system of bushwhackery in this controversy. You all know how Seward has been abused for his ``irrepressible conflict'' doctrine. The Democracy have repeated it over, and over, and over again; I call this bushwhackery because they have been reminded time after time, but could never be made to admit, that the old fathers said the same thing. They dare not deny it because they know the proof is ready at your hands to meet their denial. Jefferson said it; Washington said it. Before Seward said it, the same statement was made by Pryor of Virginia in his Richmond <span class="rend-i">Enquirer</span>, the leading paper<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;7</span>
of his State. Pryor is sent to Washington and Douglas hugs him to his bosom, but goes into fits of hydrophobia at Seward's enunciation of the same doctrine which was preached by his Virginia friend.</p>
<p>Another species of bushwhacking is exhibited in their treatment of the John Brown and Harper's Ferry affair. They insist upon it that the Republican party incites insurrections. Did they, <span class="rend-i">can</span> they ever prove their statement? They tried it in the Senate Investigation Committee and failed, but they keep saying it. We have not been fairly dealt with in this matter. We need not [have] expected that we would have been. There was some State elections to come off soon afterwards. They had just passed through elections in other States, and been whipped out. They were glad this occurred at Harper's Ferry. They said to each other---``Jump in---<span class="rend-i">now's</span> your chance!'' They were sorry there were not more killed; but taking it as they found it, they howled over it. The elections came off, but they did not result as the Democracy had expected. Each Republican knew that the charge that his party had incited the insurrection was, so far as he was concerned, a slander upon <span class="rend-i">him</span>. That is my philosophy of the result of the elections which ensued. The Democracy is still at work upon John Brown and Harper's Ferry, charging the Republicans with the crime of instigating the proceedings there; and if they think they are able to slander a woman into loving them, or a man into voting with them, they will learn better presently.</p>
<p>Now they are going to work at the shoe strike. I don't know that it comes into Connecticut. It goes into New Hampshire. A Democratic Senator gets up in the Senate Chamber and prompously announces that ``I cannot dawt thot this strike is the thresult of the onforchunit wahfar brought about boy this sucktional controvussy!'' Now whether this is so or not, I know one thing---<span class="rend-i">there is a strike</span>! And I am glad to know that there is a system of labor where the laborer can strike if he wants to! I would to God that such a system prevailed all over the world.</p>
<p>Now this strike is caused by a withdrawal of Southern trade, or it is not. If it is, what can you do to help it? Have you ever made war upon the South? No. Then how can you help yourselves? They withdraw their trade on a false accusation, because you never warred upon them, and consequently cannot stop the war they charge you with. You can, however, conform to their idea that slavery is right. This will satisfy them, but what is the effect on you? Why <span class="rend-i">slavery comes in upon you</span>! Public opinion against it gives way. The barriers which protected you from it are down;<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;8</span>
slavery comes in, and white free labor that <span class="rend-i">can</span> strike will give way to slave labor that <span class="rend-i">cannot</span>!</p>
<p>* * * * * * *</p>
<p>The Republicans want to see all parts of the Union in harmony with one another. Let us do our duty, but let us look to what our duty is, and do nothing except after due deliberation. Let us determine, if we can, what will satisfy the South. Will they be satisfied that we surrender the territories to them unconditionally? No. If we promise never to instigate an invasion upon slavery? No. Equally without avail is the fact that they have found nothing to detect us in doing them any wrong. What then? We must say that slavery is right; we must vote for Douglas's new Sedition laws; we must withdraw our statement that slavery is wrong. If a slave runs away, they overlook the natural causes which impelled him to the act; do not remember the oppression or the lashes he received, but charge us with instigating him to flight. If he screams when whipped, they say it is not caused by the pains he suffers, but he screams because we instigate him to outcrying. We do let them alone, to be sure, but they object to our saying anything against their system. They do not ask us to change our free State constitutions, but they will yet do that. After demanding <span class="rend-i">what</span> they do, and <span class="rend-i">as</span> they do, they cannot stop short of this. They may be justified in this, believing, as they do, that slavery is right, and a social blessing. We cannot act otherwise than we do, believing that slavery is wrong. If it is right, we may not contract its limits. If it is wrong, they cannot ask us to extend it. Upon these different views, hinges the whole controversy. Thinking it right, they are justified in asking its protection; thinking it wrong, we cannot consent to vote for it, or to let it extend itself. If our sense of duty forbids this extension, let us do that duty. This contrivance of a middle ground is such that he who occupies it is neither a dead or a living man. Their ``Union'' contrivances are not for us, for they reverse the scriptural order and call the righteous, not sinners to repentance. They ask men who never had an aspiration except for the Union, to swear fealty to the Union. Let us not be slandered from our duties, or intimidated from preserving our dignity and our rights by any menace; but let us have faith that Right, Eternal Right makes might, and as we understand our duty, so do it!</p>
<p>[<span class="rend-i">Evening Press</span> Version]</p>
<p>Slavery is <span class="rend-i">the</span> great political question of the nation. Though all desire its settlement, it still remains the all-pervading question of<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;9</span>
the day. It has been so especially for the past six years. It is indeed older than the revolution, rising, subsiding, then rising again, till '54, since which time it has been constantly augmenting. Those who occasioned the Lecompton imbroglio now admit that they see no end to it. It had been their cry that the vexed question was just about to be settled---``the tail of this hideous creature is just going out of sight.'' That cry is ``played out,'' and has ceased.</p>
<p>Why, when <span class="rend-i">all</span> desire to have this controversy settled, can we not settle it satisfactorily? One reason is, we want it settled in different ways. Each faction has a different plan---they pull different ways, and neither has a decided majority. In my humble opinion, the importance and magnitude of the question is underrated, even by our wisest men. If I be right, the first thing is to get a just estimate of the evil---then we can provide a cure.</p>
<p>One-sixth, and a little more, of the population of the United States are slaves---looked upon as property, as nothing but property. The cash value of these slaves, at a moderate estimate, is $2,000,000,000. This amount of property value has a vast influence on the minds of its owners, very naturally. The same amount of property would have an equal influence upon us if owned in the North. Human nature is the same---people at the South are the same as those at the North, barring the difference in circumstances. Public opinion is founded, to a great extent, on a property basis. What lessons the value of property is opposed, what enhances its value is favored. Public opinion at the South regards slaves as property and insists upon treating them like other property.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the free states carry on their government on the principle of the equality of men. We think slavery is morally wrong, and a direct violation of that principle. We <span class="rend-i">all</span> think it wrong. It is clearly proved, I think, by natural theology, apart from revelation. Every man, black, white or yellow, has a mouth to be fed and two hands with which to feed it---and that bread should be allowed to go to that mouth without controversy. (Applause.)</p>
<p>Slavery is wrong in its effect upon white people and free labor; it is the only thing that threatens the Union. It makes what Senator Seward has been much abused for calling an ``irrepressible conflict.'' When they get ready to settle it, we hope they will let us know. Public opinion settles every question here---any policy to be permanent must have public opinion at the bottom---something in accordance with the philosophy of the human mind as it is. The property basis will have its weight---the love of property and a<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;10</span>
consciousness of right or wrong have conflicting places in our organization, which often make a man's course seem crooks---his conduct a riddle.</p>
<p>Some men would make it a question of indifference---neither right nor wrong---merely a question of dollars and cents---the Almighty has drawn a line across the land, below which it must be cultivated by slave labor, above which by free labor. They would say: ``If the question is between the white man and the negro, I am for the white man; if between the negro and the crocodile, I am for the negro.'' There is a strong effort to make this policy of indifference prevail, but it can not be a durable one. A ``don't care'' policy won't prevail, for every body <span class="rend-i">does</span> care.</p>
<p>Is there a Democrat, especially one of the Douglas wing, but will declare that the Declaration of Independence has no application to the negro? It would be safe to offer a moderate premium for such a man. I have asked this question in large audiences where they were in the habit of answering right out, but no one would say otherwise. Not one of them said it five years ago. I never heard it till I heard it from the lips of Judge Douglas. True, some men boldly took the bull by the horns and said the Declaration of Independence was not true! They didn't sneak around the question. I say I <span class="rend-i">heard</span> first from Douglas that the Declaration did not apply to black men. Not a man of them said it till then---they all say it now. This is a long stride towards establishing the policy of indifference---one more such stride, I think, would do it.</p>
<p>The proposition that there is a struggle between the white man and the negro contains a falsehood. There <span class="rend-i">is</span> no struggle. <span class="rend-i">If</span> there was, I should be for the white man. If two men are adrift at sea on a plank which will bear up but one, the law justifies either in pushing the other off. I never had to struggle to keep a negro from enslaving me, nor did a negro ever have to fight to keep me from enslaving him. They say, between the crocodile and the negro they go for the negro. The logical proportion is therefore; as a white man is to a negro, so is a negro to a crocodile; or, as the negro may treat the crocodile, so the white man may treat the negro. The don't care policy leads just as surely to nationalising slavery as Jeff. Davis himself, but the doctrine is more dangerous because more insidious.</p>
<p>If the Republicans, who think slavery <span class="rend-i">is</span> wrong, get possession of the general government, we may not root out the evil at once, but may at least prevent its extension. If I find a venomous snake lying on the open praire, I seize the first stick and kill him at once. But if that snake is in bed with my children, I must be more cautious---</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;11</span>I shall, in striking the snake, also strike the children, or arouse the reptile to bite the children. Slavery is the venomous snake in bed with the children. But if the question is whether to kill it on the prairie or <span class="rend-i">put it in bed with other children</span>, I think we'd <span class="rend-i">kill</span> it! (Cheers and laughter.)</p>
<p>Another illustration. When for the first time I met Mr. Clay, the other day in the cars, in front of us sat an old gentleman with an enormous wen upon his neck. Everybody would say the wen was a great evil, and would cause the man's death after a while---but you couldn't cut it out, for he'd bleed to death in a minute. But <span class="rend-i">would you engraft the seeds of that wen on the necks of sound and healthy men?</span> He must endure and be patient, hoping for possible relief. The wen represents slavery on the neck of this country. This only applies to those who think slavery is wrong. Those who think it right would consider the snake a jewel, and the wen an ornament.</p>
<p>We want those (democrats) who think slavery wrong to quit voting with those who think it right. They don't treat it as they do other wrongs---they won't oppose it in the free states for it isn't there, nor in the slave states for it <span class="rend-i">is</span> there; don't want it in politics, for it makes agitation; not in the pulpit, for it isn't religion; not in a Tract Society, for it makes a fuss---there is no place for its discussion. Are they quite consistent in this?</p>
<p>If those democrats really think slavery wrong they will be much pleased when earnest men in the slave states take up a plan of gradual emancipation and go to work energetically and very kindly to get rid of the evil. Now let us test them. Frank Blair tried it; and he ran for Congress in '58, and got beaten. Did the democracy feel bad about it? I <span class="rend-i">reckon</span> not---I <span class="rend-i">guess</span> you all flung up your hats and shouted ``Hurrah for the Democracy!'' (Laughter---three cheers for Blair and three for Clay.)</p>
<p>He went on to speak of the manner in which slavery was treated by the Constitution. The word ``slave'' is no where used; the supply of slaves was to be prohibited after 1808; they stopped the spread of it in the territories; seven of the states abolished it. He argued very conclusively that it was then regarded as an evil which would eventually be got rid of, and that they desired, once rid of it, to have nothing in the constitution to remind them of it. The Republicans go back to first principles and deal with it as a wrong. Mason,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_11_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_11_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> of Va., said openly that the framers of our government were anti-slavery. Hammond<span class="ptr"><a name="4_11_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_11_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> of S. C., said ``Washington set this evil example.'' Bully Brooks<span class="ptr"><a name="4_11_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_11_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[4]</a></span> said: ``At the time the Constitution<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;12</span>
was formed, no one supposed slavery would last till now.'' We stick to the policy of our fathers.</p>
<p>The Democracy are given to ``bushwhacking.'' After having their errors and mis-statements continually thrust in their faces, they pay no heed, but go on howling about Seward and the ``irrepressible conflict.'' That is ``bushwhacking.'' So with John Brown and Harper's Ferry. They charge it upon the Republican party and ignominiously fail in all attempts to substantiate the charge. Yet they go on with their bushwhacking, the pack in full cry after John Brown.</p>
<p>The democrats had just been whipped in Ohio and Pennsylvania, and seized upon the unfortunate Harper's Ferry affair to influence other elections then pending. They said to each other, ``Jump in---now's your chance;'' and were sorry there were not more killed. But they didn't succeed well. Let them go on with their howling. They will succeed when by slandering women you get them to love you, and by slandering men you get them to vote for you. (Great applause.)</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln then took up the Massachusetts shoemakers' strike, treating it in a humorous and philosophical manner, and exposing to ridicule the foolish pretence of Senator Douglas---that the strike arose from ``this unfortunate sectional warfare.'' Mr. Lincoln thanked God that we have a system of labor where there <span class="rend-i">can</span> be a strike. Whatever the pressure, there is a point where the workman may stop. (Applause and cheers for free labor.)</p>
<p>He didn't pretend to be familiar with the subject of the shoe strike---probably knew as little about it as Senator Douglas himself. This strike has occurred <span class="rend-i">as</span> the Senator says, or it has not. Shall we stop making war upon the South? We never have made war upon them. If any one has, [he] better go and hang himself and save Virginia the trouble. If you give up your convictions and call slavery right as they do, you let slavery in upon you---instead of <span class="rend-i">white</span> laborers who <span class="rend-i">can</span> strike, you'll soon have <span class="rend-i">black</span> laborers who <span class="rend-i">can't</span> strike.</p>
<p>I have heard that in consequence of this ``sectional warfare,'' as Douglas calls it, Senator Mason of Va., had appeared in a <span class="rend-i">suit of homespun</span>. Now up in New Hampshire, the woolen and cotton mills are all busy, and there is no strike---they are busy making the very goods Senator Mason has quit buying! To carry out his idea, he ought to go <span class="rend-i">barefoot</span>! If that's the plan, they should begin at the <span class="rend-i">foundation</span>, and adopt the well-known ``Georgia costume'' of a shirt-collar and pair of spurs! (``Irrepressible'' laughter and applause.)</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;13</span>It reminded him of the man who had a poor old lean, bony, spavined horse, with swelled legs. He was asked what he was going to do with such a miserable beast---the poor creature would die. ``Do?'' said he. ``I'm going to fat him up; <span class="rend-i">don't you see that I have got him seal fat as high as the knees?</span>'' (Roars of laughter.) Well, they've got the Union dissolved up to the ankle, but no farther! (Applause and laughter.)</p>
<p>All portions of this confederacy should act in harmony and with careful deliberation. The democrats cry John Brown invasion. We are guiltless of it, but our denial does not satisfy them. Nothing will satisfy them but disinfecting the atmosphere entirely of all opposition to slavery. They have not demanded of us to yield the guards of liberty in our state constitutions, but it will naturally come to that after a while. If we give up to them, we cannot refuse even their utmost request. If slavery is right, it ought to be extended; if not, it ought to be restricted---there is no middle ground. Wrong as we think it, we can afford to let it alone where it of necessity now exists; but we <span class="rend-i">cannot</span> afford to extend it into free territory and around our own homes. Let us stand against it!</p>
<p>The ``Union'' arrangements are all a humbug---they reverse the scriptural order, calling the righteous and not sinners to repentance. Let us not be slandered or intimidated to turn from our duty. Eternal right makes might---as we understand our duty, let us do it!</p>

<p>MR. PRESIDENT AND FELLOW-CITIZENS OF NEW HAVEN: If the Republican party of this nation shall ever have the national house entrusted to its keeping, it will be the duty of that party to attend to all the affairs of national house-keeping. Whatever matters of importance may come up, whatever difficulties may arise in the way of its administration of the government, that party will then have to attend to. It will then be compelled to attend to other questions,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;14</span>
besides this question which now assumes an overwhelming importance---the question of Slavery. It is true that in the organization of the Republican party this question of Slavery was more important than any other; indeed, so much more important has it become that no other national question can even get a hearing just at present. The old question of tariff---a matter that will remain one of the chief affairs of national housekeeping to all time---the question of the management of financial affairs; the question of the disposition of the public domain---how shall it be managed for the purpose of getting it well settled, and of making there the homes of a free and happy people---these will remain open and require attention for a great while yet, and these questions will have to be attended to by whatever party has the control of the government. Yet, just now, they cannot even obtain a hearing, and I do not purpose to detain you upon these topics, or what sort of hearing they should have when opportunity shall come.</p>
<p>For, whether we will or not, the question of Slavery is <span class="rend-i">the</span> question, the all absorbing topic of the day. It is true that all of us---and by that I mean, not the Republican party alone, but the whole American people, here and elsewhere---all of us wish this question settled---wish it out of the way. It stands in the way, and prevents the adjustment, and the giving of necessary attention to other questions of national house-keeping. The people of the whole nation agree that this question ought to be settled, and yet it is not settled. And the reason is that they are not yet agreed <span class="rend-i">how</span> it shall be settled. All wish it done, but some wish one way and some another, and some a third, or fourth, or fifth; different bodies are pulling in different directions, and none of them having a decided majority, are able to accomplish the common object.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the year 1854 a new policy was inaugurated with the avowed object and confident promise that it would entirely and forever put an end to the Slavery agitation. It was again and again declared that under this policy, when once successfully established, the country would be forever rid of this whole question. Yet under the operation of that policy this agitation has not only not ceased, but it has been constantly augmented. And this too, although, from the day of its introduction, its friends, who promised that it would wholly end all agitation, constantly insisted, down to the time that the Lecompton bill was introduced, that it was working admirably, and that its inevitable tendency was to remove the question forever from the politics of the country. Can you call to mind any Democratic speech, made after the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, down to the time of the Lecompton bill,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;15</span>
in which it was not predicted that the Slavery agitation was just at an end; that ``the abolition excitement was played out,'' ``the Kansas question was dead,'' ``they have made the most they can out of this question and it is now forever settled.'' But since the Lecompton bill no Democrat, within my experience, has ever pretended that he could see the end. That cry has been dropped. They themselves do not pretend, now, that the agitation of this subject has come to an end yet. [Applause.]</p>
<p>The truth is, that this question is one of national importance, and we cannot help dealing with it: we must do something about it, whether we will or not. We cannot avoid it; the subject is one we cannot avoid considering; we can no more avoid it than a man can live without eating. It is upon us; it attaches to the body politic as much and as closely as the natural wants attach to our natural bodies. Now I think it important that this matter should be taken up in earnest, and really settled. And one way to bring about a true settlement of the question is to understand its true magnitude.</p>
<p>There have been many efforts to settle it. Again and again it has been fondly hoped that it was settled, but every time it breaks out afresh, and more violently than ever. It was settled, our fathers hoped, by the Missouri Compromise, but it did not stay settled. Then the compromises of 1850 were declared to be a full and final settlement of the question. The two great parties, each in National Convention, adopted resolutions declaring that the settlement made by the Compromise of 1850 was a finality---that it would last forever. Yet how long before it was unsettled again! It broke out again in 1854, and blazed higher and raged more furiously than ever before, and the agitation has not rested since.</p>
<p>These repeated settlements must have some fault about them. There must be some inadequacy in their very nature to the purpose for which they were designed. We can only speculate as to where that fault---that inadequacy, is, but we may perhaps profit by past experience.</p>
<p>I think that one of the causes of these repeated failures is that our best and greatest men have greatly underestimated the size of this question. They have constantly brought forward small cures for great sores---plasters too small to cover the wound. That is one reason that all settlements have proved so temporary---so evanescent. [Applause.]</p>
<p>Look at the magnitude of this subject! One sixth of our population, in round numbers---not quite one sixth, and yet more than a seventh,---about one sixth of the whole population of the United</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;16</span>States are slaves! The owners of these slaves consider them property. The effect upon the minds of the owners is that of property, and nothing else---it induces them to insist upon all that will favorably affect its value as property, to demand laws and institutions and a public policy that shall increase and secure its value, and make it durable, lasting and universal. The effect on the minds of the owners is to persuade them that there is no wrong in it. The slaveholder does not like to be considered a mean fellow, for holding that species of property, and hence he has to struggle within himself and sets about arguing himself into the belief that Slavery is right. The property influences his mind. The dissenting minister, who argued some theological point with one of the established church, was always met by the reply, ``I can't see it so.'' He opened the Bible, and pointed him to a passage, but the orthodox minister replied, ``I can't see it so.'' Then he showed him a single word---``Can you see that?'' ``Yes, I see it,'' was the reply. The dissenter laid a guinea over the word and asked, ``Do you see it now?'' [Great laughter.] So here. Whether the owners of this species of property do really see it as it is, it is not for me to say, but if they do, they see it as it is through 2,000,000,000 of dollars, and that is a pretty thick coating. [Laughter.] Certain it is, that they do not see it as we see it. Certain it is, that this two thousand million of dollars, invested in this species of property, all so concentrated that the mind can grasp it at once---this immense pecuniary interest, has its influence upon their minds.</p>
<p>But here in Connecticut and at the North Slavery does not exist, and we see it through no such medium. To us it appears natural to think that slaves are human beings; <span class="rend-i">men</span>, not property; that some of the things, at least, stated about men in the Declaration of Independence apply to them as well as to us. [Applause.] I say, we think, most of us, that this Charter of Freedom applies to the slave as well as to ourselves, that the class of arguments put forward to batter down that idea, are also calculated to break down the very idea of a free government, even for white men, and to undermine the very foundations of free society. [Continued applause.] We think Slavery a great moral wrong, and while we do not claim the right to touch it where it exists, we wish to treat it as a wrong in the Territories, where our votes will reach it. We think that a respect for ourselves, a regard for future generations and for the God that made us, require that we put down this wrong where our votes will properly reach it. We think that species of labor an injury to free white men---in short, we think Slavery a great moral, social and political evil, tolerable only because, and<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;17</span>
so far as its actual existence makes it necessary to tolerate it, and that beyond that, it ought to be treated as a wrong.</p>
<p>Now these two ideas, the property idea that Slavery is right, and the idea that it is wrong, come into collision, and do actually produce that irrepressible conflict which Mr. Seward has been so roundly abused for mentioning. The two ideas conflict, and must conflict.</p>
<p>Again, in its political aspect, does anything in any way endanger the perpetuity of this Union but that single thing, Slavery? Many of our adversaries are anxious to claim that they are specially devoted to the Union, and take pains to charge upon us hostility to the Union. Now we claim that we are the only true Union men, and we put to them this one proposition: What ever endangered this Union, save and except Slavery? Did any other thing ever cause a moment's fear? All men must agree that this thing alone has ever endangered the perpetuity of the Union. But if it was threatened by any other influence, would not all men say that the best thing that could be done, if we could not or ought not to destroy it, would be at least to keep it from growing any larger? Can any man believe that the way to save the Union is to extend and increase the only thing that threatens the Union, and to suffer it to grow bigger and bigger? [Great applause.]</p>
<p>Whenever this question shall be settled, it must be settled on some philosophical basis. No policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained. And hence, there are but two policies in regard to Slavery that can be at all maintained. The first, based on the property view that Slavery is right, conforms to that idea throughout, and demands that we shall do everything for it that we ought to do if it were right. We must sweep away all opposition, for opposition to the right is wrong; we must agree that Slavery is right, and we must adopt the idea that property has persuaded the owner to believe---that Slavery is morally right and socially elevating. This gives a philosophical basis for a permanent policy of encouragement.</p>
<p>The other policy is one that squares with the idea that Slavery is wrong, and it consists in doing everything that we ought to do if it is wrong. Now, I don't wish to be misunderstood, nor to leave a gap down to be misrepresented, even. I don't mean that we ought to attack it where it exists. To me it seems that if we were to form a government anew, in view of the actual presence of Slavery we should find it necessary to frame just such a government as our fathers did; giving to the slaveholder the entire control where the system was established, while we possessed the power to restrain<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;18</span>
it from going outside those limits. [Applause.] From the necessities of the case we should be compelled to form just such a government as our blessed fathers gave us; and, surely, if they have so made it, that adds another reason why we should let Slavery alone where it exists.</p>
<p>If I saw a venomous snake crawling in the road, any man would say I might seize the nearest stick and kill it; but if I found that snake in bed with my children, that would be another question. [Laughter.] I might hurt the children more than the snake, and it might bite them. [Applause.] Much more, if I found it in bed with my neighbor's children, and I had bound myself by a solemn compact not to meddle with his children under any circumstances, it would become me to let that particular mode of getting rid of the gentleman alone. [Great laughter.] But if there was a bed newly made up, to which the children were to be taken, and it was proposed to take a batch of young snakes and put them there with them, I take it no man would say there was any question how I ought to decide! [Prolonged applause and cheers.]</p>
<p>That is just the case! The new Territories are the newly made bed to which our children are to go, and it lies with the nation to say whether they shall have snakes mixed up with them or not. It does not seem as if there could be much hesitation what our policy should be! [Applause.]</p>
<p>Now I have spoken of a policy based on the idea that Slavery is wrong, and a policy based upon the idea that it is right. But an effort has been made for a policy that shall treat it as neither right or wrong. It is based upon utter indifference. Its leading advocate has said ``I don't care whether it be voted up or down.'' [Laughter.] ``It is merely a matter of dollars and cents.'' ``The Almighty has drawn a line across this continent, on one side of which all soil must forever be cultivated by slave labor, and on the other by free;'' ``when the struggle is between the white man and the negro, I am for the white man; when it is between the negro and the crocodile, I am for the negro.'' Its central idea is indifference. It holds that it makes no more difference to us whether the Territories become free or slave States, than whether my neighbor stocks his farm with horned cattle or puts it into tobacco. All recognize this policy, the plausible sugar-coated name of which is ``<span class="rend-i">popular sovereignty</span>.'' [Laughter.]</p>
<p>This policy chiefly stands in the way of a permanent settlement of the question. I believe there is no danger of its becoming the permanent policy of the country, for it is based on a public indifference. There is nobody that ``don't care.'' ALL THE PEOPLE DO</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;19</span>CARE! one way or the other. [Great applause.] I do not charge that its author, when he says he ``don't care,'' states his individual opinion; he only expresses his policy for the government. I understand that he has never said, as an individual, whether he thought Slavery right or wrong---and he is the only man in the nation that has not! Now such a policy may have a temporary run; it may spring up as necessary to the political prospects of some gentleman; but it is utterly baseless; the people are not indifferent; and it can therefore have no durability or permanence.</p>
<p>But suppose it could! Then it could be maintained only by a public opinion that shall say ``we don't care.'' There must be a change in public opinion, the public mind must be so far debauched as to square with this policy of caring not at all. The people must come to consider this as ``merely a question of dollars and cents,'' and to believe that in some places the Almighty has made Slavery necessarily eternal. This policy can be brought to prevail if the people can be brought round to say honestly ``we don't care;'' if not, it can never be maintained. It is for you to say whether that can be done. [Applause.]</p>
<p>You are ready to say it cannot, but be not too fast! Remember what a long stride has been taken since the repeal of the Missouri Compromise! Do you know of any Democrat, of either branch of the party---do you know one who declares that he believes that the Declaration of Independence has any application to the negro? Judge Taney declares that it has not, and Judge Douglas even vilifies me personally and scolds me roundly for saying that the Declaration applies to all men, and that negroes are men. [Cheers.] Is there a Democrat here who does not deny that the Declaration applies to a negro? Do any of you know of one? Well, I have tried before perhaps fifty audiences, some larger and some smaller than this, to find one such Democrat, and never yet have I found one who said I did not place him right in that. I must assume that Democrats hold that, and now, <span class="rend-i">not one of these Democrats can show that he said that five years ago</span>! [Applause.] I venture to defy the whole party to produce one man that ever uttered the belief that the Declaration did not apply to negroes, before the repeal of the Missouri Compromise! Four or five years ago we all thought negroes were men, and that when ``<span class="rend-i">all men</span>'' were named, negroes were included. But <span class="rend-i">the whole Democratic party has deliberately taken negroes from the class of men and put them in the class of brutes</span>. [Applause.] Turn it as you will, it is simply the truth! Don't be too hasty then in saying that the people cannot be brought to this new doctrine, but note that long stride. One<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;20</span>
more as long completes the journey, from where negroes are estimated as men to where they are estimated as mere brutes---as rightful property!</p>
<p>That saying, ``in the struggle between the white man and the negro,'' &amp;c., which I know came from the same source as this policy---that saying marks another step. There is a falsehood wrapped up in that statement. ``In the struggle between the white man and the negro'' assumes that there is a struggle, in which either the white man must enslave the negro or the negro must enslave the white. There is no such struggle! It is merely an ingenious falsehood, to degrade and brutalize the negro. Let each let the other alone, and there is no struggle about it. If it was like two wrecked seamen on a narrow plank, when each must push the other off or drown himself, I would push the negro off or a white man either, but it is not; the plank is large enough for both. [Applause.] This good earth is plenty broad enough for white man and negro both, and there is no need of either pushing the other off. [Continued applause.]</p>
<p>So that saying, ``in the struggle between the negro and the crocodile,'' &amp;c., is made up from the idea that down where the crocodile inhabits a white man can't labor; it must be nothing else but crocodile inhabits a white man can't labor; it must be nothing else but crocodile or negro; if the negro does not the crocodile must possess the earth; [laughter;] in that case he declares for the negro. The meaning of the whole is just this: As a white man is to a negro, so is a negro to a crocodile; and as the negro may rightfully treat the crocodile, so may the white man rightfully treat the negro. This very dear phrase coined by its author, and so dear that he deliberately repeats it in many speeches, has a tendency to still further brutalize the negro, and to bring public opinion to the point of utter indifference whether men so brutalized are enslaved or not. When that time shall come, if ever, I think that policy to which I refer may prevail. But I hope the good freemen of this country will never allow it to come, and until then the policy can never be maintained.</p>
<p>Now consider the effect of this policy. We in the States are not to care whether Freedom or Slavery gets the better, but the people in the Territories may care. They are to decide, and they may think what they please; it is a matter of dollars and cents! But are not the people of the Territories detailed from the States? If this feeling of indifference---this absence of moral sense about the question---prevails in the States, will it not be carried into the Territories? Will not every man say, ``I don't care, it is nothing to me?'' If any one comes that wants Slavery, must they not say, ``I don't<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;21</span>
care whether Freedom or Slavery be voted up or voted down?'' It results at last in naturalizing [nationalizing?]<span class="ptr"><a name="4_21_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_21_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> the institution of Slavery. Even if fairly carried out, that policy is just as certain to naturalize [nationalize] Slavery as the doctrine of Jeff Davis himself. These are only two roads to the same goal, and ``popular sovereignty'' is just as sure and almost as short as the other. [Applause.]</p>
<p>What we want, and all we want, is to have with us the men who think slavery wrong. But those who say they hate slavery, and are opposed to it, but yet act with the Democratic party---where are they? Let us apply a few tests. You say that you think slavery is wrong, but you denounce all attempts to restrain it. Is there anything else that you think wrong, that you are not willing to deal with as a wrong? Why are you so careful, so tender of this one wrong and no other? [Laughter.] You will not let us <span class="rend-i">do</span> a single thing as if it was wrong; where is no place where you will allow it to be even <span class="rend-i">called</span> wrong! We must not call it wrong in the Free States, because it is <span class="rend-i">not</span> there, and we must not call it wrong in the Slave States because it <span class="rend-i">is</span> there; we must not call it wrong in politics because that is bringing morality into politics, and we must not call it wrong in the pulpit because that is bringing politics into religion; we must not bring it into the Tract Society or the other societies, because those are such unsuitable places, and there is no single place, according to you, where this wrong thing can properly be called wrong! [Continued laughter and applause.]</p>
<p>Perhaps you will plead that if the people of Slave States should themselves set on foot an effort for emancipation, you would wish them success, and bid them God-speed. Let us test that! In 1858, the emancipation party of Missouri, with Frank Blair at their head, tried to get up a movement for that purpose, and having started a party contested the State. Blair was beaten, apparently if not truly, and when the news came to Connecticut, you, who knew that Frank Blair was taking hold of this thing by the right end, and doing the only thing that you say can properly be done to remove this wrong---did you bow your heads in sorrow because of that defeat? Do you, any of you, know one single Democrat that showed sorrow over that result? Not one! On the contrary every man threw up his hat, and hallooed at the top of his lungs, ``hooray for Democracy!'' [Great laughter and applause.]</p>
<p>Now, gentlemen, <span class="rend-i">the Republicans desire to place this great question of slavery on the very basis on which our fathers placed it</span>,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;22</span><span class="rend-i">and no other</span>. [Applause.] It is easy to demonstrate that ``our Fathers, who framed this government under which we live,'' looked on Slavery as wrong, and so framed it and everything about it as to square with the idea that it was wrong, so far as the necessities arising from its existence permitted. In forming the Constitution they found the slave trade existing; capital invested in it; fields depending upon it for labor, and the whole system resting upon the importation of slave-labor. They therefore did not prohibit the slave trade at once, but they gave the power to prohibit it after twenty years. Why was this? What other foreign trade did they treat in that way? Would they have done this if they had not thought slavery wrong?</p>
<p>Another thing was done by some of the same men who framed the Constitution, and afterwards adopted as their own act by the first Congress held under that Constitution, of which many of the framers were members; they prohibited the spread of Slavery into Territories. Thus the same men, the framers of the Constitution, cut off the supply and prohibited the spread of Slavery, and both acts show conclusively that they considered that the thing was wrong.</p>
<p>If additional proof is wanting it can be found in the phraseology of the Constitution. When men are framing a supreme law and chart of government, to secure blessings and prosperity to untold generations yet to come, they use language as short and direct and plain as can be found, to express their meaning. In all matters but this of Slavery the framers of the Constitution used the very clearest, shortest, and most direct language. But the Constitution alludes to Slavery three times without mentioning it once! The language used becomes ambiguous, roundabout, and mystical. They speak of the ``immigration of persons,'' and mean the importation of slaves, but do not say so. In establishing a basis of representation they say ``all other persons,'' when they mean to say slaves---why did they not use the shortest phrase? In providing for the return of fugitives they say ``persons held to service or labor.'' If they had said slaves it would have been plainer, and less liable to misconstruction. Why didn't they do it. We cannot doubt that it was done on purpose. Only one reason is possible, and that is supplied us by one of the framers of the Constitution---and it is not possible for man to conceive of any other---they expected and desired that the system would come to an end, and meant that when it did, the Constitution should not show that there ever had been a slave in this good free country of ours! [Great applause.]</p>
<p>I will dwell on that no longer. I see the signs of the approaching<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;23</span>
triumph of the Republicans in the bearing of their political adversaries. A great deal of their war with us now-a-days is mere bushwhacking. [Laughter.] At the battle of Waterloo, when Napoleon's cavalry had charged again and again upon the unbroken squares of British infantry, at last they were giving up the attempt, and going off in disorder, when some of the officers in mere vexation and complete despair fired their pistols at those solid squares. The Democrats are in that sort of extreme desperation; it is nothing else. [Laughter.] I will take up a few of these <span class="rend-i">arguments</span>.</p>
<p>There is ``THE IRREPRESSIBLE CONFLICT.'' [Applause.] How they rail at Seward for that saying! They repeat it constantly; and although the proof has been thrust under their noses again and again, that almost every good man since the formation of our government has uttered that same sentiment, from Gen. Washington, who ``trusted that we should yet have a confederacy of Free States,'' with Jefferson, Jay, Monroe, down to the latest days, yet they refuse to notice that at all, and persist in railing at Seward for saying it. Even Roger A. Pryor, editor of the Richmond Enquirer, uttered the same sentiment in almost the same language, and yet so little offence did it give the Democrats that he was sent for to Washington to edit the States---the Douglas organ there, while Douglas goes into hydrophobia and spasms of rage because Seward dared to repeat it. [Great applause.] This is what I call bushwhacking, a sort of argument that they must know any child can see through.</p>
<p>Another is JOHN BROWN! [Great laughter.] You stir up insurrections, you invade the South! John Brown! Harper's Ferry! Why, John Brown was not a Republican! You have never implicated a single Republican in that Harper's Ferry enterprise. We tell you that if any member of the Republican party is guilty in that matter, you know it or you do not know it. If you do know it, you are inexcusable not to designate man and prove the fact. If you do not know it, you are inexcusable to assert it, and especially to persist in the assertion after you have tried and failed to make the proof. You need not be told that persisting in a charge which one does not know to be true is simply malicious slander. Some of you admit that no Republican designedly aided or encouraged the Harper's Ferry affair; but still insist that our doctrines and declarations necessarily lead to such results. We do not believe it. We know we hold to no doctrines, and make no declarations, which were not held to and made by our fathers who framed the Government under which we live, and we cannot see how declarations that were patriotic when they made them are villainous when we make them. You never dealt fairly by us in relation to that<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;24</span>
affair---and I will say frankly that I know of nothing in your character that should lead us to suppose that you would. You had just been soundly thrashed in elections in several States, and others were soon to come. You rejoiced at the occasion, and only were troubled that there were not three times as many killed in the affair. You were in evident glee---there was no sorrow for the killed nor for the peace of Virginia disturbed---you were rejoicing that by charging Republicans with this thing you might get an advantage of us in New York, and the other States. You pulled that string as tightly as you could, but your very generous and worthy expectations were not quite fulfilled. [Laughter.] Each Republican knew that the charge was a slander as to himself at least, and was not inclined by it to cast his vote in your favor. It was mere bushwhacking, because you had nothing else to do. You are still on that track, and I say, go on! If you think you can slander a woman into loving you or a man into voting for you, try it till you are satisfied! [Tremendous applause.]</p>
<p>Another specimen of this bushwhacking, that ``shoe strike.'' [Laughter.] Now be it understood that I do not pretend to know all about the matter. I am merely going to speculate a little about some of its phases. And at the outset, <span class="rend-i">I am glad to see that a system of labor prevails in New England under which laborers CAN strike</span> when they want to [Cheers,] where they are not obliged to work under all circumstances, and are not tied down and obliged to labor whether you pay them or not! [Cheers.] I <span class="rend-i">like</span> the system which lets a man quit when he wants to, and wish it might prevail everywhere. [Tremendous applause.] One of the reasons why I am opposed to Slavery is just here. What is the true condition of the laborer? I take it that it is best for all to leave each man free to acquire property as fast as he can. Some will get wealthy. I don't believe in a law to prevent a man from getting rich; it would do more harm than good. So while we do not propose any war upon capital, we do wish to allow the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with everybody else. [Applause.] When one starts poor, as most do in the race of life, free society is such that he knows he can better his condition; he knows that there is no fixed condition of labor, for his whole life. I am not ashamed to confess that twenty five years ago I was a hired laborer, mauling rails, at work on a flat-boat---just what might happen to any poor man's son! [Applause.] I want every man to have the chance---and I believe a black man is entitled to it---in which he <span class="rend-i">can</span> better his condition ---when he may look forward and hope to be a hired laborer this year and the next, work for himself afterward, and finally to hire<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;25</span>
men to work for him! That is the true system. Up here in New England, you have a soil that scarcely sprouts black-eyed beans, and yet where will you find wealthy men so wealthy, and poverty so rarely in extremity? There is not another such place on earth! [Cheers.] I desire that if you get too thick here, and find it hard to better your condition on this soil, you may have a chance to strike and go somewhere else, where you may not be degraded, nor have your family corrupted by forced rivalry with negro slaves. I want you to have a clean bed, and no snakes in it! [Cheers.] Then you can better your condition, and so it may go on and on in one ceaseless round so long as man exists on the face of the earth! [Prolonged applause.]</p>
<p>Now, to come back to this shoe strike,---if, as the Senator from Illinois asserts, this is caused by withdrawal of Southern votes, consider briefly how you will meet the difficulty. You have done nothing, and have protested that you have done nothing, to injure the South. And yet, to get back the shoe trade, you must leave off doing something that you are now doing. What is it? You must stop thinking slavery wrong! Let your institutions be wholly changed; let your State Constitutions be subverted, glorify slavery, and so you will get back the shoe trade---for what? You have brought owned labor with it to compete with your own labor, to under work you, and to degrade you! Are you ready to get back the trade on those terms?</p>
<p>But the statement is not correct. You have not lost that trade; orders were never better than now! Senator Mason, a Democrat, comes into the Senate in homespun, a proof that the dissolution of the Union has actually begun! but orders are the same. Your factories have not struck work, neither those where they make anything for coats, nor for pants, nor for shirts, nor for ladies' dresses. Mr. Mason has not reached the manufacturers who ought to have made him a coat and pants! To make his proof good for anything he should have come into the Senate barefoot! (Great laughter.)</p>
<p>Another bushwhacking contrivance; simply that, nothing else! I find a good many people who are very much concerned about the loss of Southern trade. Now either these people are sincere or they are not. (Laughter.) I will speculate a little about that. If they are sincere, and are moved by any real danger of the loss of Southern trade, they will simply get their names on the white list,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_25_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_25_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;26</span>
and then, instead of persuading Republicans to do likewise, they will be glad to keep you away! Don't you see they thus shut off competition? They would not be whispering around to Republicans to come in and share the profits with them. But if they are not sincere, and are merely trying to fool Republicans out of their votes, they will grow very anxious about <span class="rend-i">your</span> pecuniary prospects; they are afraid you are going to get broken up and ruined; they did not care about Democratic votes---<span class="rend-i">Oh no, no, no!</span> You must judge which class those belong to whom you meet; I leave it to you to determine from the facts.</p>
<p>Let us notice some more of the stale charges against Republicans. You say we are sectional. We deny it. That makes an issue; and the burden of proof is upon you. You produce your proof; and what is it? Why, that our party has no existence in your section---gets no votes in your section. The fact is substantially true; but does it prove the issue? If it does, then in case we should, without change of principle, begin to get votes in your section, we should thereby cease to be sectional. You cannot escape this conclusion; and yet, are you willing to abide by it? If you are, you will probably soon find that we have ceased to be sectional, for we shall get votes in your section this very year. [Applause.] The fact that we get no votes in your section is a fact of your making, and not of ours. And if there be fault in that fact, that fault is primarily yours, and remains so until you show that we repel you by some wrong principle or practice. If we do repel you by any wrong principle or practice, the fault is ours; but this brings you to where you ought to have started---to a discussion of the right or wrong of our principle. If our principle, put in practice, would wrong your section for the benefit of ours, or for any other object, then our principle, and we with it, are sectional, and are justly opposed and denounced as such. Meet us, then, on the question of whether our principle, put in practice, would wrong your section; and so meet it as if it were possible that something may be said on our side. Do you accept the challenge? No? Then you really believe that the principle which our fathers who framed the Government under which we live thought so clearly right as to adopt it, and indorse it again and again, upon their official oaths, is, in fact, so clearly wrong as to demand your condemnation without a moment's consideration.</p>
<p>Some of you delight to flaunt in our faces the warning against sectional parties given by Washington in his Farewell address. Less than eight years before Washington gave that warning, he had, as President of the United States, approved and signed an<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;27</span>
act of Congress, enforcing the prohibition of Slavery in the northwestern Territory, which act embodied the policy of Government upon that subject, up to and at the very moment he penned that warning; and about one year after he penned it he wrote LaFayette that he considered that prohibition a wise measure, expressing in the same connection his hope that we should some time have a confederacy of Free States.</p>
<p>Bearing this in mind, and seeing that sectionalism has since arisen upon this same subject, is that warning a weapon in your hands against us, or in our hands against you? Could Washington himself speak, would he cast the blame of that sectionalism upon us, who sustain his policy, or upon you who repudiate it? We respect that warning of Washington, and we commend it to you, together with his example pointing to the right application of it. [Applause.]</p>
<p>But you say you are conservative---eminently conservative---while we are revolutionary, destructive, or something of the sort. What is conservatism? Is it not adherenece to the old and tried, against the new and untried? We stick to, contend for, the identical old policy on the point in controversy which was adopted by our fathers who framed the Government under which we live; while you with one accord reject, and scout, and spit upon that old policy, and insist upon substituting something new. True, you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be. You have considerable variety of new propositions and plans, but you are unanimous in rejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers. Some of you are for reviving the foreign slave-trade; some for a Congressional Slave-Code for the Territories; some for Congress forbidding the Territories to prohibit Slavery within their limits; some for maintaining Slavery in the Territories through the Judiciary; some for the ``gur-reat pur-rin-ciple'' that ``if one man would enslave another, no third man should object,'' fantastically called ``Popular Sovereignty;'' [great laughter,] but never a man among you in favor of Federal prohibition of Slavery in Federal Territories, according to the practice of our fathers who framed the Government under which we live. Not one of all your various plans can show a precedent or an advocate in the century within which our Government originated. And yet you draw yourselves up and say ``We are eminently conservative!'' [Great laughter.]</p>
<p>It is exceedingly desirable that all parts of this great Confederacy shall be at peace, and in harmony, one with another. Let us Republicans do our part to have it so. Even though much provoked,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;28</span>
let us do nothing through passion and ill temper. Even though the Southern people will not so much as listen to us, let us calmly consider their demands, and yield to them if, in our deliberate view of our duty, we possibly can. Judging by all they say and do, and by the subject and nature of their controversy with us, let us determine, if we can, what will satisfy them?</p>
<p>Will they be satisfied if the Territories be unconditionally surrendered to them? We know they will not. In all their present complaints against us, the Territories are scarcely mentioned. Invasions and insurrections are the rage now. Will it satisfy them if, in the future, we have nothing to do with invasions and insurrections? We know it will not. We so know because we know we never had anything to do with invasions and insurrections; and yet this total abstaining does not exempt us from the charge and the denunciation.</p>
<p>The question recurs, what will satisfy them? Simply this: we must not only let them alone, but we must, somehow, convince them that we do let them alone. [Applause.] This, we know by experience, is no easy task. We have been so trying to convince them, from the very beginning of our organization, but with no success. In all our platforms and speeches, we have constantly protested our purpose to let them alone; but this has had no tendency to convince them. Alike unavailing to convince them is the fact that they have never detected a man of us in any attempt to disturb them.</p>
<p>These natural and apparently adequate means all failing, what will convince them? This, and this only; cease to call slavery <span class="rend-i">wrong</span>, and join them in calling it <span class="rend-i">right</span>. And this must be done thoroughly---done in <span class="rend-i">acts</span> as well as in <span class="rend-i">words</span>. Silence will not be tolerated---we must place ourselves avowedly with them. Douglas's new sedition law must be enacted and enforced, suppressing all delcarations that Slavery is wrong, whether made in politics, in presses, in pulpits, or in private. We must arrest and return their fugitive slaves with greedy pleasure. We must pull down our Free State Constitutions. The whole atmosphere must be disinfected of all taint of opposition to Slavery, before they will cease to believe that all their troubles proceed from us. So long as we call Slavery wrong, whenever a slave runs away they will overlook the obvious fact that he ran because he was oppressed, and declare he was stolen off. Whenever a master cuts his slaves with the lash, and they cry out under it, he will overlook the obvious fact that the negroes cry out because they are hurt, and insist that they were <span class="rend-i">put up to it by some rascally abolitionist</span>. [Great laughter.]</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;29</span>I am quite aware that they do not state their case precisely in this way. Most of them would probably say to us, ``Let us alone, do nothing to us, and say what you please about Slavery.'' But we do let them alone---have never disturbed them---so that, after all, it is what we say, which dissatisfies them. They will continue to accuse us of doing, until we cease saying.</p>
<p>I am also aware they have not, as yet, in terms, demanded the overthrow of our Free State Constitutions. Yet those Constitutions declare the wrong of Slavery, with more solemn emphasis than do all other sayings against it; and when all these other sayings shall have been silenced, the overthrow of these Constitutions will be demanded, and nothing be left to resist the demand. It is nothing to the contrary, that they do not demand the whole of this just now. Demanding what they do, and for the reason they do, they can voluntarily stop nowhere short of this consummation. Holding as they do, that Slavery is morally right, and socially elevating, they cannot cease to demand a full national recognition of it, as a legal right, and a social blessing.</p>
<p>Nor can we justifiably withhold this, on any ground save our conviction that Slavery is wrong. If Slavery is right, all words, acts, laws, and Constitutions against it, are themselves wrong, and should be silenced, and swept away. If it is right, we cannot justly object to its nationality---its universality; if it is wrong, they cannot justly insist upon its extension---its enlargement. All they ask, we could as readily grant, if they thought it wrong. Their thinking it right, and our thinking it wrong, is the precise fact upon which depends the whole controversy. Thinking it right as they do, they are not to blame for desiring its full recognition, as being right; but, thinking it wrong, as we do, can we yield to them? Can we cast our votes with their view, and against our own? In view of our moral, social, and political responsibilities, can we do this?</p>
<p>Wrong as we think Slavery is, we can yet afford to let it alone where it is, because that much is due to the necessity arising from its actual presence in the nation; but can we, while our votes will prevent it, allow it to spread into the National Territories, and to overrun us here in these Free States?</p>
<p>If our sense of duty forbids this, then let us stand by our duty, fearlessly and effectively. Let us be diverted by none of those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously plied and belabored---contrivances such as groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong, vain as the search for a man who should be neither a living man nor a dead man---such as<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;30</span>
a policy of ``don't care'' on a question about which all true men do care---such as Union appeals beseeching true Union men to yield to Disunionists, reversing the divine rule, and calling, not the sinners, but the righteous to repentance---such as invocations of Washington, imploring men to unsay what Washington did.</p>
<p>Neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us, nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the Government, nor of dungeons to ourselves. Let us have faith that right makes might; and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty, as we understand it.</p>

<p>I have just returned from the East. Before leaving, I received your letter of Feb. 6; and on my return I find those of the 17th. &amp; 19th. with Genl. Lane's<span class="ptr"><a name="4_31_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_31_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> note inclosed in one of them.</p>
<p>I sincerely wish you could be elected one of the first Senators for Kansas; but how to help you I do not know. If it were permissable for me to interfere, I am not personally acquainted with a single member of your Legislature. If my known friendship for you could be of any advantage, that friendship was abundantly manifested by me last December while in Kansas. If any member had written me, as you say some have Trumbull, I would very readily answer him. I shall write Trumbull on the subject at this sitting.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;32</span>I understood, while in Kansas, that the State Legislature will not meet until the State is admitted. Was that the right understanding?</p>
<p>As to your kind wishes for myself, allow me to say I can not enter the ring on the money basis---first, because, in the main, it is wrong; and secondly, I have not, and can not get, the money. I say, in the main, the use of money is wrong; but for certain objects, in a political contest, the use of some, is both right, and indispensable. With me, as with yourself, this long struggle has been one of great pecuniary loss. I now distinctly say this. If you shall be appointed a delegate to Chicago, I will furnish one hundred dollars to bear the expences of the trip.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_32_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_32_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>My dear Sir: When I first saw by the despaches that Douglas had run from the Senate while you were speaking I did not quite understand it; but seeing by the report that you were cramming down his throat that infernal stereotyped lye of his about ``negro equality'' the thing became plain.</p>
<p>Another matter. Our friend Delahay wants to be one of the Senators from Kansas. Certainly it is not for outsiders to obtrude their interference. Delahay has suffered a great deal in our cause, and been very faithful to it, as I understand. He writes me that some of the members of the Kansas Legislature have written you in a way that your simple answer might help him. I wish you would consider whether you can not assist him that far, without impropriety. I know it is a delicate matter; and I do not wish to press you beyond your own judgment<span class="ptr"><a name="4_32_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_32_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> Yours as ever</p>

If I have any chance, it consists mainly in the fact that the <span class="rend-i">whole</span> opposition would vote for me if nominated. (I dont mean to include the pro-slavery opposition of the South, of course.) My name is new in the field; and I suppose I am not the <span class="rend-i">first</span> choice of a very great many. Our policy, then, is to give no offence to others---leave them in a mood to come to us, if they shall be compelled to give up their first love. This, too, is dealing justly with all, and leaving us in a mood to support heartily whoever shall be nominated. I believe I have once before told you that I especially wish to do no ungenerous thing towards Governor Chase, because he gave us his sympathy in 1858, when scarcely any other distinguished man did. Whatever you may do for me, consistently with these suggestions, will be appreciated, and gratefully remembered.</p>

<p>My Dear Sir Reaching home yesterday after an absence of more than two weeks, I found your letter of the 24th of March. Remembering that when not a very great man begins to be mentioned for a very great position, his head is very likely to be a little turned, I concluded I am not the fittest person to answer the questions you ask. Making due allowance for this, I think Mr. Seward is the very best candidate we could have for the North of Illinois, and the very <span class="rend-i">worst</span> for the South of it. The estimate of Gov. Chase here is neither better nor worse than that of Seward, except that he is a newer man. They are regarded as being almost the same, seniority giving Seward the inside track. Mr. Bates, I think, would be the best man for the South of our State, and the worst for the North of it. If Judge McLean was fifteen, or even ten years younger, I think he would be stronger than either, in our state, taken as a whole; but his great age, and the recollection of the deaths of Harrison and Taylor have, so far, prevented his being much spoken of here.</p>
<p>I really believe we can carry the state for either of them, or for any one who may be nominated; but doubtless it would be easier to do it with some than with others.</p>

I made the speech, and left for New Hampshire, where I have a son at school, neither asking for pay nor having any offered me. Three days after, a check for $200--- was sent to me, at N.H., and I took it, <span class="rend-i">and did not know it was wrong</span>. My understanding now is, though I knew nothing of it at the time, that they did charge for admittance, at the Cooper Institute, and that they took in more than twice $200.</p>
<p>I have made this explanation to you as a friend; but I wish no explanation made to our enemies. What they want is a squabble and a fuss; and that they can have if we explain; and they can not have if we don't.</p>
<p>When I returned through New York from New England I was told by the gentlemen who sent me the check, that a drunken vagabond in the Club, having learned something about the $200, made the exhibition out of which <span class="rend-i">The Herald</span> manufactured the article quoted by <span class="rend-i">The Press</span> of your town.</p>
<p>My judgment is, and therefore my request is, that you give no denial, and no explanations.</p>
<p>Thanking you for your kind interest in the matter, I remain,</p>
<p>Yours truly, A. LINCOLN.</p>

The fact that there is no letter of invitation from Carson in the Lincoln Papers is strange, especially since Herbruger's letter is preserved. The original letter to Carson has not been located, and in view of the almost identical text in Tracy, the editors have wondered whether the letter to Carson actually exists. A letter from Carson, July 19, 1860 (DLC-RTL), in which he introduces himself, as if for the first time, and offers to deliver 150 or 200 votes which he claims to control, in consideration of his appointment to a job in the postoffice or customs, is so written as to suggest that he had never before written to or received a letter from Lincoln.</p>

<div class="textindentlevelx">
<div class="opener">April 10, 1860</div>
<p>On Tuesday evening last, Hon. Abram Lincoln delivered a speech at Phoenix Hall in this city, of which we took tolerably full note, and of which we should be pleased to give a fuller notice than the crowded state of our columns today will permit. We shall, however, endeavor to state his points distinctly, and in such a manner as to do him no injustice.</p>
<p>After a few apologetic remarks, the speaker proceeded to comment upon polygamy in Utah, and the recent action in the United States house of representatives on that subject.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_41_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_41_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> He said his main object in doing so was to call attention to the views and action of gentlemen who held to the doctrine of popular sovereignty, as related to the suppression of polygamy. These gentlemen, he said, were less than half the democratic members of the house---southern democrats voting for the anti-polygamy bill, because it favored the doctrine that congress could control the subject of <span class="rend-i">slavery</span> in the territories. But the Illinois democrats, although as much opposed to polygamy as any body else, dare not vote for the bill, because it was opposed to Mr. Douglas.</p>
<p>Mr. McClernand, of Illinois, had proposed to suppress the evil of polygamy by dividing up the territory, and attaching the different portions to other territories. He admitted that he had not seen Col. McClernand's speech on the subject; but proceeded to comment upon his action, nevertheless. McClernand's proposition was in harmony with the views formerly suggested by Mr. Douglas in a speech at Springfield; and he gave him credit for consistency, at least. But, inquired the speaker, how much better was it to divide up the territory and attach its parts to others? It was effecting indirectly that which Mr. McClernand denied could be done directly. This inconsistency, Mr. Lincoln illustrated by a classic example of a similar inconsistency: ``If I cannot rightfully murder a man, I may tie him to the tail of a kicking horse, and let him kick the man to death!''</p>
<p>But why divide up the territory at all? continued he. Something must be wrong there, or it would not be necessary to act at all. And if one mode of interference is wrong, why not the other? Why is not an act dividing the territory as much against popular sovereignty<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;42</span>
as one for prohibiting polygamy? If you can put down polygamy in that way, why may you not thus put down slavery?</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln said he <span class="rend-i">supposed</span> that the friends of popular sovereignty would say---if they dared speak out---that <span class="rend-i">polygamy</span> was wrong and slavery right; and therefore one might thus be put down and the other not; and after <span class="rend-i">supposing</span> several other things of northern democrats, he proceeded to notice, what he called, Mr. Douglas's sedition law.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_42_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_42_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span></p>
<p>On the subject of the proposed law, he began by reading Mr. Douglas's resolution as offered to the senate. Everything prohibited in the resolution, said he, is wrong, and ought to be prohibited and punished. There was now no such law against them, simply, as he supposed, because nobody had thought the crimes enumerated in the resolution would ever be committed. And, moreover, he declared, not one of them ever had been committed! He defied any one to point to a single instance where the authorities or the people of one state had invaded another: or where there had been a conspiracy or combination to interfere with the institutions or property of the people in one state by citizens of another! John Brown, to be sure, had made a raid into Virginia; but Virginia had been competent to deal with him and his confederates without a congressional law; and hence no such law was necessary. Insurrections had always been put down; hence no law was necessary against them. What, then, inquired the speaker, was the <span class="rend-i">real</span> object of Mr. Douglas's proposition? He then quoted from that gentleman's speech on the subject, in which he says that Brown's raid into Virginia, and similar outrages, were the legitimate and logical result of the abolition teachings of the day. Then, said Mr. Lincoln, I conceive the real object of the proposed bill was to put down republicanism; to prevent republican meetings, and to shut men's mouths! If, however, he added, the only object is to punish negro-dealers, he had no objection. But he denied that any body had ever conspired to steal negroes.</p>
<p>The speaker then went on to comment on the proposed law, as if it was only meant to suppress free speech; addressed his remarks chiefly to Mr. Douglas, and throughout the speech seemed to consider him as the only man in the democratic party who was worthy of attention. A few words on the question why, if states and territories may introduce slavery, McLean county, or any individual may not, according to popular sovereignty, do the same, concluded the speech.</p>

<p>As you request, I will be entirely frank. The taste <span class="rend-i">is</span> in my mouth a little; and this, no doubt, disqualifies me, to some extent, to form correct opinions. You may confidently rely, however, that by no advice or consent of mine, shall my presentations be pressed to the point of endangering our common cause.</p>
<p>Now, as to my opinions about the chances of others in Illinois. I think neither Seward nor Bates can carry Illinois if Douglas shall be on the track; and that either of them can, if he shall not be. I rather think McLean could carry it with D. on or off---in<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;46</span>
other words, I think McLean is stronger in Illinois, taking all sections of it, than either S. or B; and I think S. the weakest of the three. I hear no objection to McLean, except his age; but that objection seems to occur to every one; and it is possible it might leave him no stronger than the others. By the way, if we should nominate him, how would we save to ourselves the chance of filling his vacancy in the Court? Have him hold on up to the moment of his inaugeration? Would that course be no draw-back upon us in the canvass?</p>
<p>Recurring to Illinois, we want something here quite as much as, and which is harder to get than, the electoral vote---the Legislature. And it is exactly in this point that Seward's nomination would be hard upon us. Suppose he should gain us a thousand votes in Winnebago, it would not compensate for the loss of fifty in Edgar.</p>
<p>A word now for your own special benefit. You better write no letters which can possibly be distorted into opposition, or quasi opposition to me. There are men on the constant watch for such things out of which to prejudice my peculiar friends against you. While I have no more suspicion of you than I have of my best friend living, I am kept in a constant struggle against suggestions of this sort. I have hesitated some to write this paragraph, lest you should suspect I do it for my own benefit, and not for yours; but on reflection I conclude you will not suspect me.</p>
<p>Let no eye but your own see this---not that there is anything wrong, or even ungenerous, in it; but it would be misconstrued. Your friend as ever A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>Your very kind letter of the 27th. was received yesterday. This writing being early in the morning, Douglas is not yet nominated; but we suppose he certainly will be before sun-set to-day, a few of the smaller Southern states having seceded from the convention---just enough to permit his nomination, and not enough to hurt him much at the election. This puts the case in the hardest shape for us. But fight we must; and conquer we shall; in the end.</p>

<p>We now understand that Douglas will be nominated to-day by what is left of the Charleston convention. All parties here dislike it. Republicans and Danites, that he should be nominated at all; and Doug. Dem's that he should not be nominated by an undivided convention. Yours as ever A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>Dear Sir: Yours of the 30th. ult. is just received. After what you have said, it is perhaps proper I should post you, so far as I am able, as to the ``lay of the land.'' First then, I think the Illinois delegation will be unanamous for me at the start; and no other delegation will. A few individuals in other delegations would like to go for me at the start, but may be restrained by their colleagues. It is represented to me, by men who ought to know, that the whole of Indiana might not be difficult to get. You know how it is in Ohio. I am certainly not the first choice there; and yet I have not heard that any one makes any positive objection to me. It is just so everywhere so far as I can perceive. Everywhere, except in Illinois, and possibly Indiana, one or another is prefered to me, but there is no positive objection. This is the ground as it now appears. I believe you personally know C. M.

I now think the Tariff question ought not to be agitated in the Chicago convention; but that all should be satisfied on that point, with a presidential candidate, whose antecedents give assurance that he would neither seek to force a tariff-law by Executive influence; nor yet to arrest a reasonable one, by a veto, or otherwise. Just such a candidate I desire shall be put in nomination. I really have no objection to these views being publicly known; but I do wish to thrust no letter before the public now, upon any subject.

The letter is accompanied by a copy in Lincoln's handwriting of the letter of Ashmun and others to Lincoln, May 18, 1860, which copy Ashmun requested in a letter dated May 21, for purposes of publication (DLC-RTL). Apparently Ashmun had not preserved a complete copy of his letter written as chairman and bearing the signature of the other members of the convention committee, and therefore asked Lincoln to furnish a copy along with his answer. Lincoln to Ashmun, May 26, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>, indicates that both Lincoln's answering letter dated May 23 and his copy of Ashmun's letter dated May 18 were sent on May 26. Whether Lincoln had mailed an earlier copy of his letter of acceptance on May 23, the day it was written, is not certain, since no other original ALS is known. One infers, however, that Lincoln had composed the draft preserved in the Lincoln Papers on May 23, that in reply to Ashmun's request of May 21, he copied it, together with a copy of Ashmun's letter of notification, and mailed them on May 26. If so, the additional letter of May 23, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>, presents a further puzzle. The original has not been located, and there is some question of its authenticity, unless the original is forthcoming. It appears, however, to have a place and function only if Lincoln did not compose his final reply until May 26, and then dated it back to May 23 both in the draft and the letter sent. The brevity and haste apparent in the contents of the short letter (<span class="rend-i">infra</span>) may indicate this conclusion.</p>

I do not think I ever saw you, though I very well know who you are---so well that I recognized your hand-writing, on opening your letter, before I saw the signature. My recollection is that Ben.

<p>[2]&nbsp;&nbsp; It is unfortunate that Haycraft's letter is not extant, for Lincoln scholars have long wondered about his mistake. His later testimony to Herndon about Nancy Hanks' identity seems not to have been clear. It has been assumed that Haycraft's letter referred to Sally Bush Johnston as Lincoln's mother, but the assumption is hardly tenable since Haycraft knew about Thomas Lincoln's early residence at Elizabethtown and could scarcely have identified her as the mother of Thomas Lincoln's first child, whom he supposed to have been Abraham instead of Sarah. Probably Haycraft did not know Nancy Hanks at all, and in common with others among his Kentucky contemporaries, who began cudgeling their brains after Lincoln's nomination, confused her, as well as her mother with another notorious ``Nancy'' whose reputation has survived the years because of its unsavory quality. In spite of diligent research and scholarly criticism of sources, the status of research on the lineage of Nancy Hanks must be summarized as inconclusive. The best sources are Louis A. Warren, <span class="rend-i">Lincoln's Parentage &amp; Childhood</span> (c. 1926) and William E. Barton, <span class="rend-i">The Lineage of Lincoln</span> (1929) and <span class="rend-i">The Paternity of Abraham Lincoln</span> (1920).

<p>My Dear Sir: Yours of the 23rd, accompanied by a copy of the speech delivered by me at the Cooper Institute, and upon which you have made some notes for emendations, was received some days ago. Of course I would not object to, but would be pleased rather, with a more perfect edition of that speech.</p>
<p>I did not preserve memoranda of my investigations; and I could not now re-examine, and make notes, without an expenditure of time which I can not bestow upon it. Some of your notes I do not understand.</p>
<p>So far as it is intended merely to improve in grammar, and elegance of composition, I am quite agreed; but I do not wish the sense changed, or modified, to a hair's breadth. And you, not having studied the particular points so closely as I have, can not be quite sure that you do not change the sense when you do not intend it. For instance, in a note at bottom of first page, you proposed to substitute ``Democrats'' for ``Douglas.'' But what I am saying there is <span class="rend-i">true</span> of Douglas, and is not true of ``Democrats'' generally; so that the proposed substitution would be a very considerable blunder. Your proposed insertion of ``residences'' though it would do little or no harm, is not at all necessary to the sense I was trying to convey. On page 5 your proposed grammatical change would certainly do no harm. The ``<span class="rend-i">impundently absurd</span>'' I stick to. The striking out ``<span class="rend-i">he</span>'' and inserting ``<span class="rend-i">we</span>'' turns the sense exactly wrong. The striking out ``<span class="rend-i">upon it</span>'' leaves the sense too general and incomplete. The sense is ``act as they acted <span class="rend-i">upon that question</span>''---not as they acted generally.</p>
<p>After considering your proposed changes on page 7, I do not think them material, but I am willing to defer to you in relation to them.</p>
<p>On page 9, striking out ``<span class="rend-i">to us</span>'' is probably right. The word ``<span class="rend-i">lawyer's</span>'' I wish retained. The word ``<span class="rend-i">Courts</span>'' struck out twice, I<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;59</span>
wish reduced to ``Court'' and retained. ``Court'' as a collection more<span class="ptr"><a name="4_59_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_59_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> properly governs the plural ``have'' as I understand. ``The'' preceding ``Court,'' in the latter case, must also be retained. The words ``quite,'' ``as,'' and ``or'' on the same page, I wish retained. The italicising, and quotation marking, I have no objection to.</p>
<p>As to the note at bottom, I do not think any too much is admitted. What you propose on page 11 is right. I return your copy of the speech, together with one printed here, under my own hasty supervising. That at New York was printed without any supervision by me. If you conclude to publish a new edition, allow me to see the proof-sheets.</p>
<p>And now thanking you for your very complimentary letter, and your interest for me generally, I subscribe myself. Your friend and servant,</p>

<div class="opener">[c. June, 1860]</div>
<p>Abraham Lincoln was born Feb. 12, 1809, then in Hardin, now in the more recently formed county of Larue, Kentucky. His father, Thomas, &amp; grand-father, Abraham, were born in Rockingham county Virginia, whither their ancestors had come from Berks county Pennsylvania. His lineage has been traced no farther back than this.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_60_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_60_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> The family were originally quakers, though in later times they have fallen away from the peculiar habits of that<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;61</span>
people. The grand-father Abraham, had four brothers---Isaac, Jacob, John &amp; Thomas. So far as known, the descendants of Jacob and John are still in Virginia. Isaac went to a place near where Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee, join; and his decendants are in that region. Thomas came to Kentucky, and after many years, died there, whence his decendants went to Missouri. Abraham, grandfather of the subject of this sketch, came to Kentucky, and was killed by indians about the year 1784. He left a widow, three sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Mordecai, remained in Kentucky till late in life, when he removed to Hancock county, Illinois, where soon after he died, and where several of his descendants still reside. The second son, Josiah, removed at an early day to a place on Blue River, now within Harrison [Hancock] county, Indiana; but no recent information of him, or his family, has been obtained. The eldest sister, Mary, married Ralph Crume and some of her descendants are now known to be in Breckenridge county Kentucky. The second sister, Nancy, married William Brumfield, and her family are not known to have left Kentucky, but there is no recent information from them. Thomas, the youngest son, and father of the present subject, by the early death of his father, and very narrow circumstances of his mother, even in childhood was a wandering laboring boy, and grew up litterally without education. He never did more in the way of writing than to bunglingly sign his own name. Before he was grown, he passed one year as a hired hand with his uncle Isaac on Wata[u]ga, a branch of the Holsteen [Holston] River. Getting back into Kentucky, and having reached his 28th. year, he married Nancy Hanks---mother of the present subject---in the year 1806. She also was born in Virginia; and relatives of hers of the name of Hanks, and of other names, now reside in Coles, in Macon, and in Adams counties, Illinois, and also in Iowa. The present subject has no brother or sister of the whole or half blood. He had a sister, older than himself, who was grown and married, but died many years ago, leaving no child. Also a brother, younger than himself, who died in infancy. Before leaving Kentucky he and his sister were sent for short periods, to A.B.C. schools, the first kept by Zachariah Riney, and the second by Caleb Hazel.</p>
<p>At this time his father resided on Knob-creek, on the road from Bardstown Ky. to Nashville Tenn. at a point three, or three and a half miles South or South-West of Atherton's ferry on the Rolling Fork. From this place he removed to what is now Spencer county Indiana, in the autumn of 1816, A. then being in his eigth year. This removal was partly on account of slavery; but chiefly on account<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;62</span>
of the difficulty in land titles in Ky.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_62_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_62_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> He settled in an unbroken forest; and the clearing away of surplus wood was the great task a head. A. though very young, was large of his age, and had an axe put into his hands at once; and from that till within his twentythird year, he was almost constantly handling that most useful instrument---less, of course, in plowing and harvesting seasons. At this place A. took an early start as a hunter, which was never much improved afterwards. (A few days before the completion of his eigth year, in the absence of his father, a flock of wild turkeys approached the new log-cabin, and A. with a rifle gun, standing inside, shot through a crack, and killed one of them. He has never since pulled a trigger on any larger game.) In the autumn of 1818 his mother died; and a year afterwards his father married Mrs. Sally Johnston, at Elizabeth-Town, Ky---a widow, with three children of her first marriage. She proved a good and kind mother to A. and is still living in Coles Co. Illinois. There were no children of this second marriage. His father's residence continued at the same place in Indiana, till 1830. While here A. went to A.B.C. schools by littles, kept successively by Andrew Crawford, --- Sweeney,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_62_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_62_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[4]</a></span> and Azel W. Dorsey. He does not remember any other. The family of Mr. Dorsey now reside in Schuyler Co. Illinois. A. now thinks that the agregate of all his schooling did not amount to one year. He was never in a college or Academy as a student; and never inside of a college or accademy building till since he had a law-license. What he has in the way of education, he has picked up. After he was twentythree, and had separated from his father, he studied English grammar, imperfectly of course, but so as to speak and write as well as he now does. He studied and nearly mastered the Six-books of Euclid, since he was a member of Congress. He regrets his want of education, and does what he can to supply the want. In his tenth year he was kicked by a horse, and apparently killed for a time. When he was nineteen, still residing in Indiana, he made his first trip upon a flat-boat to New-Orleans. He was a hired hand merely; and he and a son of the owner,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_62_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_62_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[5]</a></span> without other assistance, made the trip. The nature of part of the cargo-load, as it was called---made it necessary for them to linger and trade along the Sugar coast---and one night they were attacked by seven negroes with intent to kill and rob them. They were hurt some in the melee, but succeeded in driving the negroes from the boat, and then ``cut cable'' ``weighed anchor'' and left.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;63</span>March 1st. 1830---A. having just completed his 21st. year, his father and family, with the families of the two daughters and sons-in-law, of his step-mother, left the old homestead in Indiana, and came to Illinois. Their mode of conveyance was waggons drawn by ox-teams, or A. drove one of the teams. They reached the county of Macon, and stopped there some time within the same month of March. His father and family settled a new place on the North side of the Sangamon river, at the junction of the timber-land and prairie, about ten miles Westerly from Decatur. Here they built a log-cabin, into which they removed, and made sufficient of rails to fence ten acres of ground, fenced and broke the ground, and raised a crop of sow[n] corn upon it the same year. These are, or are supposed to be, the rails about which so much is being said just now, though they are far from being the first, or only rails ever made by A.</p>
<p>The sons-in-law, were temporarily settled at other places in the county. In the autumn all hands were greatly afflicted with augue and fever, to which they had not been used, and by which they were greatly discouraged---so much so that they determined on leaving the county. They remained however, through the succeeding winter, which was the winter of the very celebrated ``deep snow'' of Illinois. During that winter, A. together with his step-mother's son, John D. Johnston, and John Hanks, yet residing in Macon county, hired themselves to one Denton Offutt, to take a flat boat from Beardstown Illinois to New-Orleans; and for that purpose, were to join him---Offut---at Springfield, Ills so soon as the snow should go off. When it did go off which was about the 1st. of March 1831---the county was so flooded, as to make traveling by land impracticable; to obviate which difficulty the[y] purchased a large canoe and came down the Sangamon river in it. This is the time and the manner of A's first entrance into Sangamon County. They found Offutt at Springfield, but learned from him that he had failed in getting a boat at Beardstown. This lead to their hiring themselves to him at $12 per month, each; and getting the timber out of the trees and building a boat at old Sangamon Town on the Sangamon river, seven miles N.W. of Springfield, which boat they took to New-Orleans, substantially upon the old contract. It<span class="ptr"><a name="4_63_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_63_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[6]</a></span> was in connection with this boat that occurred<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;64</span>
the ludicrous incident of sewing up the hogs eyes. Offutt bought thirty odd large fat live hogs, but found difficulty in driving them from where [he] purchased them to the boat, and thereupon conceived the whim that he could sew up their eyes and drive them where he pleased. No sooner thought of than decided, he put his hands, including A. at the job, which they completed---all but the driving. In their blind condition they could not be driven out of the lot or field they were in. This expedient failing, they were tied and hauled on carts to the boat. It was near the Sangamon River, within what is now Menard county.</p>
<p>During this boat enterprize acquaintance with Offutt, who was previously an entire stranger, he conceved a liking for A. and believing he could turn him to account, he contracted with him to act as clerk for him, on his return from New-Orleans, in charge of a store and Mill at New-Salem, then in Sangamon, now in Menard county. Hanks had not gone to New-Orleans, but having a family, and being likely to be detained from home longer than at first expected, had turned back from St. Louis. He is the same John Hanks who now engineers the ``rail enterprize'' at Decatur; and is a first cousin to A's mother. A's father, with his own family &amp; others mentioned, had, in pursuance of their intention, removed from Macon to Coles county. John D. Johnston, the step-mother's son, went to them; and A. stopped indefinitely, and, for the first time, as it were, by himself at New-Salem, before mentioned. This was in July 1831. Here he rapidly made acquaintances and friends. In less than a year Offutt's business was failing---had almost failed,---when the Black-Hawk war of 1832---broke out. A joined a volunteer company, and to his own surprize, was elected captain of it. He says he has not since had any success in life which gave him so much satisfaction. He went the campaign, served near three months, met the ordinary hardships of such an expedition, but was in no battle. He now owns in Iowa, the land upon which his own warrants for this service, were located. Returning from the campaign, and encouraged by his great popularity among his immediate neighbors, he, the same year, ran for the Legislature and was beaten---his own precinct, however, casting it's votes 277 for and 7, against him. And this too while he was an avowed Clay man, and the precinct the autumn afterwards, giving a majority of 115 to Genl. Jackson over Mr. Clay. This was the only time A was ever beaten on a direct vote of the people. He was now without means and out of business, but was anxious to remain with his friends who had treated him with so much generosity,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;65</span>
especially as he had nothing elsewhere to go to. He studied what he should do---thought of learning the black-smith trade---thought of trying to study law---rather thought he could not succeed at that without a better education. Before long, strangely enough, a man offered to sell and did sell, to A. and another<span class="ptr"><a name="4_65_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_65_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[7]</a></span> as poor as himself, an old stock of goods, upon credit. They opened as merchants; and he says that was <span class="rend-i">the</span> store. Of course they did nothing but get deeper and deeper in debt. He was appointed Post-master at New-Salem---the office being too insignificant, to make his politics an objection. The store winked out. The Surveyor of Sangamon,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_65_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_65_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[8]</a></span> offered to depute to A that portion of his work which was within his part of the county. He accepted, procured a compass and chain, studied Flint, and Gibson a little, and went at it. This procured bread, and kept soul and body together. The election of 1834 came, and he was then elected to the Legislature by the highest vote cast for any candidate. Major John T. Stuart, then in full practice of the law, was also elected. During the canvass, in a private conversation he encouraged A. [to] study law. After the election he borrowed books of Stuart, took them home with him, and went at it in good earnest. He studied with nobody. He still mixed in the surveying to pay board and clothing bills. When the Legislature met, the law books were dropped, but were taken up again at the end of the session. He was re-elected in 1836, 1838, and 1840. In the autumn of 1836 he obtained a law licence, and on April 15, 1837 removed to Springfield, and commenced the practice, his old friend, Stuart taking him into partnership. March 3rd. 1837, by a protest entered upon the Ills. House Journal of that date, at pages 817, 818, A. with Dan Stone, another representative of Sangamon, briefly defined his position on the slavery question; and so far as it goes, it was then the same that it is now. The protest is as follows---(Here insert it)<span class="ptr"><a name="4_65_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_65_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[9]</a></span> In 1838, &amp; 1840 Mr. L's party in the Legislature voted for him as Speaker; but being in the minority, he was not elected. After 1840 he declined a re-election to the Legislature. He was on the Harrison electoral ticket in 1840, and on that of Clay in 1844, and spent much time and labor in both those canvasses. In Nov. 1842 he was married to Mary, daughter of Robert S. Todd, of Lexington, Kentucky. They have three living children, all sons---one born in 1843, one in 1850, and one in 1853. They lost one, who was born in 1846. In 1846, he was elected to the lower House of Congress, and served one term only,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;66</span>
commencing in Dec. 1847 and ending with the inaugeration of Gen. Taylor, in March 1849. All the battles of the Mexican war had been fought before Mr. L. took his seat in congress, but the American army was still in Mexico, and the treaty of peace was not fully and formally ratified till the June afterwards. Much has been said of his course in Congress in regard to this war. A careful examination of the Journals and Congressional Globe shows, that he voted for all the supply measures which came up, and for all the measures in any way favorable to the officers, soldiers, and their families, who conducted the war through; with this exception that some of these measures passed without years and nays, leaving no record as to how particular men voted. The Journals and Globe also show him voting that the war was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the President of the United States. This is the language of Mr. Ashmun's amendment, for which Mr. L. and nearly or quite all, other whigs of the H. R. voted.</p>
<p>Mr. L's reasons for the opinion expressed by this vote were briefly that the President had sent Genl. Taylor into an inhabited part of the country belonging to Mexico, and not to the U.S. and thereby had provoked the first act of hostility---in fact the commencement of the war; that the place, being the country bordering on the East bank of the Rio Grande, was inhabited by native Mexicans, born there under the Mexican government; and had never submitted to, nor been conquered by Texas, or the U.S. nor transferred to either by treaty---that although Texas claimed the Rio Grande as her boundary, Mexico had never recognized it, the people on the ground had never recognized it, and neither Texas nor the U.S. had ever enforced it---that there was a broad desert between that, and the country over which Texas had actual control---that the country where hostilities commenced, having once belonged to Mexico, must remain so, until it was somehow legally transferred, which had never been done.</p>
<p>Mr. L. thought the act of sending an armed force among the Mexicans, was <span class="rend-i">unnecessary</span>, inasmuch as Mexico was in no way molesting, or menacing the U.S. or the people thereof; and that it was <span class="rend-i">unconstitutional</span>, because the power of levying war is vested in Congress, and not in the President. He thought the principal motive for the act, was to divert public attention from the surrender of ``Fifty-four, forty, or fight'' to Great Brittain, on the Oregon boundary question.</p>
<p>Mr. L. was not a candidate for re-election. This was determined upon, and delcared before he went to Washington, in accordance with an understanding among whig friends, by which Col. Hardin,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;67</span>
and Col. Baker had each previously served a single term in the same District.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_67_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_67_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1848, during his term in congress, he advocated Gen. Taylor's nomination for the Presidency, in opposition to all others, and also took an active part for his election, after his nomination---speaking a few times in Maryland, near Washington, several times in Massachusetts, and canvassing quite fully his own district in Illinois, which was followed by a majority in the district of over 1500 for Gen. Taylor.</p>
<p>Upon his return from Congress he went to the practice of the law with greater earnestness than ever before. In 1852 he was upon the Scott electroal ticket, and did something in the way of canvassing, but owning to the hopelessness of the cause in Illinois, he did less than in previous presidential canvasses.</p>
<p>In 1854, his profession had almost superseded the thought of politics in his mind, when the repeal of the Missouri compromise aroused him as he had never been before.</p>
<p>In the autumn of that year he took the stump with no broader practical aim or object that [than?] to secure, if possible, the re-election of Hon Richard Yates to congress. His speeches at once attracted a more marked attention than they had ever before done. As the canvass proceeded, he was drawn to different parts of the state, outside of Mr. Yates' district. He did not abandon the law, but gave his attention, by turns, to that and politics. The State agricultural fair was at Springfield that year, and Douglas was announced to speak there.</p>
<p>In the canvass of 1856, Mr. L. made over fifty speeches, no one of which, so far as he remembers, was put in print. One of them was made at Galena, but Mr. L. has no recollection of any part of it being printed; nor does he remember whether in that speech he said anything about a Supreme court decision. He may have spoken upon that subject; and some of the newspapers may have reported him as saying what is now ascribed to him; but he thinks he could not have expressed himself as represented.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_67_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_67_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>``Hon. A. Lincoln Cincinnati, June 5. 1860</p>
<p>Dr. Sir: We are extremely sorry to be under the necessity of calling your attention to the inclosed bill during your sojourn at the ``Burnet'' in Sept. last; but it appears there is no remedy left us other than to advise you of it's never having been paid. We relied upon the Republican committee, but as yet have not been able to find any one being willing to take the responsibility of paying same---consequently advise you in the premises. Very Respy.</p>
<p>Yours, Johnson, Saunders &amp; Co['']</p>
<p>The inclosed bill is as follows:</p>
<p>``Burnet House</p>
<p>Cincinnati, Sept. 19--- 1859</p>
<p>Hon: A. Lincoln</p>
<p>To Johnson, Saunders &amp; Co. Dr.</p>
<p>Board &amp; Parlor self &amp; family	37.50</p>
<p>Extra Suppers. 3.50. Wines, Liquors &amp; cigars 7.50.	11.00</p>
<p>Occupancy of room No. 15. committee.	5.00</p>
<p>	------</p>
<p>	$53.50''</p>
<p>Now this may be right, but I have a slight suspicion of it, for two or three reasons. First, when I left, I called at the office of the Hotel, and was there distinctly told the bill ``was settled'' ``was all right'' or words to that effect. Secondly, it seems a little steep that ``Board &amp; parlor[''] from Saturday 71/2 P.M. to Monday 101/2 A.M. for a man woman and one small child, should be $37.50. Thirdly, we had no extra suppers, unless having tea at our room the first evening, was such. We were in the house over the time of five meals, three only of which we took in the house. We did not once dine in the house. As to wines, liquors &amp; cigars, we had none---absolutely none. These last may have been in room 15, by order of Committee, but I do not recollect them at all.</p>
<p>Please look into this, and write me. I can and will pay it if it is<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;73</span>

<p>Your letter of June 5th. is received. I have no money collected by me for Mr. Vance, and I had ceased trying to collect any for him long before his death. You speak of my letters to Mr. Vance; and if I remember, they will show that the charge of Mr. Vance's claim here was transferred to Mr. W. H. Herndon. I think his claim was against a man, or men, by the name of Vanmeter. I never keep any body's money, which I collect, an hour longer than I can find a chance to turn it over to him. If you doubt this, get some of the busy bodies who are imposing on you in this matter, to find somebody who will swear he paid me money for Mr. Vance. If there is any such man he can be found.</p>
<p>If, as you say, Mr. Trimble spoke to me, and I gave him no satisfaction, it was because the truth was not satisfactory. Let Mr. Trimble or any one else come here and see the man or men, of whom they or you, think I received money for Mr. Vance, and learn of them how the truth is. I have no papers in my hands, belonging to Mr. Vance. I do not certainly know, but my opinion is that nothing can be got on those old claims, or that old claim of Mr. Vance. Yours &amp;c A.

<p>Yours of May 22nd. was duly received; and now, on a careful re-perusal of it, I am much mortified that I did not attend to it at once. I fear I have no sufficient apology. I received it with multitudes of others, glanced over it too hastily to properly appreciate its' importance, laid it by, and it passed from my mind, till Gov. Koerner mentioned it to-day. In a general bringing up of my correspondence, I perhaps should have reached it to-day.</p>
<p>The main object of the letter---time---so far as it depended on <span class="rend-i">me</span>, is lost. I hope you have gone forward on your plan without my advice. To me it appears an excellent plan; and I have no sufficient experience to suggest any improvement of it. I think it would be desireable to have the opinion of the National committee upon it, if it can be obtained without too much loss of time.</p>
<p>And now, upon this bad beginning, you must not determine to write me no more; for I promise you, that no letter of yours to me, shall ever again be neglected.</p>

<p>Your very kind letter of the 15th. is received. Messrs. Follett, Foster &amp; Co's Life of me is <span class="rend-i">not</span> by my authority; and I have scarcely been so much astounded by anything, as by their public announcement<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;80</span>
that it is authorized by me. They have fallen into some strange misunderstanding. I certainly knew they contemplated publishing a biography, and I certainly did not object to their doing so, <span class="rend-i">upon their own responsibility</span>. I even took pains to facilitate them. But, at the same time, I made myself tiresome, if not hoarse, with repeating to Mr. Howard, their only agent seen by me, my protest that I <span class="rend-i">authorized nothing</span>---would be <span class="rend-i">responsible for nothing</span>. How, they could so misunderstand me, passes comprehension. As a matter, <span class="rend-i">wholly my own</span>, I would authorize no biography, without <span class="rend-i">time</span>, and <span class="rend-i">opertunity</span> to carefully examine and consider every word of it; and, in this case, in the nature of things, I can have no such time and opertunity. But, in my present position, when, by the lessons of the past, and the united voice of all discreet friends, I am neither [to] write or speak a word for the public, how dare I to send forth, by my authority, a volume of hundreds of pages, for adversaries to make points upon without end. Were I to do so, the convention would have a right to reassemble, and substitute another name for mine.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I would not look at the proof sheets. I am determined to maintain the position of truly saying I never saw the proof sheets, or any part of their work, before it's publication.</p>
<p>Now, do not mistake me. I feel great kindness for Messrs. F. F. &amp; Co---do not think they have intentionally done wrong. There may be nothing wrong in their proposed book. I sincerely hope there will not. I barely suggest that you, or any of the friends there, on the party account, look it over, &amp; exclude what you may think would embarrass the party---bearing in mind, at all times, that I <span class="rend-i">authorize nothing</span>---will be <span class="rend-i">responsible</span> for <span class="rend-i">nothing</span>.

Thompson's letter of July 6 recounted plans of the Indiana Constitutional Unionists to run a Bell electoral ticket, which he opposed, and said that one of his chief arguments was that Lincoln, if elected, would not be ``led into ultraism by radical men, but your administration will be national. If I could succeed in fixing this influence upon their mind, I should have little difficulty.'' He added that he wished to see Lincoln and ``talk about some things that you ought not to write about,'' but that if he came to Springfield it would ``get into the papers.'' (DLC-RTL).

Hon. A. Jonas: Springfield, Ills.<br>
My dear Sir July 21, 1860</div>
<p>Yours of the 20th. is received. I suppose as good, or even better, men than I may have been in American, or Know-Nothing lodges; but in point of fact, I never was in one, at Quincy, or elsewhere. I was never in Quincy but one day and two nights, while Know-Nothing lodges were in existence, and you were with me that day and both those nights. I had never been there before in my life; and never afterwards, till the joint debate with Douglas in 1858. It was in 1854, when I spoke in some Hall there,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_85_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_85_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> and after the speaking, you, with others, took me to, an oyster saloon, passed an hour there, and you walked with me to, and parted with me at, the Quincy-House, quite late at night. I left by stage for Naples before day-light in the morning, having come in by the same route, after dark, the evening previous to the speaking, when I found you waiting at the Quincy House to meet me. A few days after I<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;86</span>
was there, Richardson,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_86_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_86_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> as I understood, started this same story about my having been in a Know-Nothing lodge. When I heard of the charge, as I did soon after, I taxed my recollection for some incident which could have suggested it; and I remembered that on parting with you the last night, I went to the Office of the Hotel to take my stage passage for the morning, was told that no stage office for that line was kept there, and that I must see the driver, before retiring, to insure his calling for me in the morning; and a servant was sent with me to find the driver, who after taking me a square or two, stopped me, and stepped perhaps a dozen steps farther, and in my hearing called to some one, who answered him apparantly from the upper part of a building, and promised to call with the stage for me at the Quincy House. I returned and went to bed; and before day the stage called and took me. This is all.</p>
<p>That I never was in a Know-Nothing lodge in Quincy, I should expect, could be easily proved, by respectable men, who were always in the lodges and never saw me there. An affidavit of one or two such would put the matter at rest.</p>
<p>And now, a word of caution. Our adversaries think they can gain a point, if they could force me to openly deny this charge, by which some degree of offence would be given to the Americans. For this reason, it must not publicly appear that I am paying any attention to the charge. Yours truly A. LINCOLN</p>

<div class="opener">Friend Francis--- Springfield, Ills. Aug. 4. 1860</div>
<p>I have had three letters from you---one, a long one, received in February; one, telling me of the deputation of Mr. Greely to cast the vote of Oregon, in the Chicago convention, received a few days before that convention; and one written since you knew the result of your Oregon election, received a few days ago. I have not, till now, attempted an answer to any of them, because I disliked<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;90</span>
to write you a mere note, and because I could not find time to write at length.</p>
<p>Your brother Allen has returned from California, and, I understand, intends remaining here. Josiah<span class="ptr"><a name="4_90_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_90_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> is running his J. P. court, about as when you left. We had a storm here last night which did considerable damage, the largest single instance of which, was to the Withies.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_90_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_90_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> A well of their brick shop building was thrown in, and, it is said destroyed ten thousand dollars worth of carriages. I have heard of no personal injury done.</p>
<p>When you wrote, you had not learned of the doings of the democratic convention at Baltimore; but you will be in possession of it all long before this reaches you. I hesitate to say it, but it really appears now, as if the success of the Republican ticket is inevitable. We have no reason to doubt any of the states which voted for Fremont. Add to these, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and New-Jersey, and the thing is done. Minnesota is as sure as such a thing can be; while the democracy are so divided between Douglas and Breckenridge in Penn. &amp; N.J. that they are scarcely less sure. Our friends are also confident in Indiana and Illinois. I should expect the same division would give us a fair chance in Oregon. Write me what you think on that point.</p>
<p>We were very anxious here for David Logan's election. I think I will write him before long. If you see Col. Baker,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_90_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_90_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[4]</a></span> give him my respects. I do hope he may not be tricked out of what he has fairly earned.</p>
<p>Make my kindest regards to Mrs. Francis; and tell her I both hope and believe she is not so unhappy as when I saw her last. Your friend, as ever A. LINCOLN</p>

Five speakers' stands (other papers said ``six'') were filled simultaneously. Lincoln's arrival on the grounds occasioned a stampede for his carriage, whence he was lifted and carried above the crowd to one of the stands. After his brief remarks he escaped by stratagem on horseback while the expectant crowd massed around the carriage. The Cincinnati <span class="rend-i">Gazette</span> reporter admitted that ``Immense is the only word that describes to-day's demonstration. . . . The enthusiasm was beyond all bounds. . . .

<p>My dear Sir: Your very kind letter of the 6th was received yesterday. It so happened that our State Central Committee was in session here at the time; and, thinking it proper to do so, I submitted the letter to them. They were delighted with the assurance of having your assistance. For what appear good reasons, they, however, propose a change in the program, starting you at the same place (Marshall in Clark County), and thence northward. This change, I suppose, will be agreeable to you, as it will give you larger audiences, and much easier travel---nearly all being by railroad. They will be governed by your time, and when they shall have fully designated the places, you will be duly notified.</p>

John B. Fry, Esq Springfield, Ills. August 15. 1860</div>
<p>My dear Sir: Yours of the 9th. inclosing the letter of Hon. John M. Botts, was duly received. The latter is herewith returned according to your request. It contains one of the many assurances I receive from the South that in no probable event will there be any very formidable effort to break up the Union. The people of the South have too much of good sense, and good temper, to attempt the ruin of the government, rather than see it administered as it was administered by the men who made it. At least, so I hope and believe.</p>
<p>I thank you both for your own letter, and a sight of that of Mr. Botts. Yours, very truly A. LINCOLN</p>

Hon. George G. Fogg--- Springfield, Ills.<br>
My dear Sir: Aug. 16, 1860</div>
<p>I am annoyed some by the printed paragraph below, in relation to myself, taken from the N.Y. Herald's correspondence from this place of August 8th.</p>
<p>He had, he said, on one occasion been invited to go into Kentucky and revisit some of the scenes with whose history his father in his life-time had been identified. On asking by letter whether Judge Lynch would be present, he received no response; and he therefore came to the conclusion that the invitation was a trap laid by some designing person to inveigle him into a slave State for the purpose of doing violence to his person.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_96_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_96_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>This is decidedly wrong. I did not say it. I do not impugn the correspondent. I suppose he misconceived the statement from the following incident. Soon after the Chicago nomination I was written to by a highly respectable gentleman of Hardin County, Ky, inquiring if I was a son of Thomas Lincoln, whom he had known long ago, in that county. I answered that I was, and that I was myself born there. He wrote again, and, among other things, (did not <span class="rend-i">invite</span> me but) simply <span class="rend-i">inquired</span> if it would not be agreeable to me to revisit the scenes of my childhood. I replied, among other things, ``It would indeed; but would you not Lynch me?'' He did not write again.</p>
<p>I have, <span class="rend-i">playfully</span>, (and never otherwise) related this incident several times; and I suppose I did so to the Herald correspondent, though I do not remember it. If I did, it is all that I did say, from which the correspondent could have inferred his statement.</p>
<p>Now, I dislike, exceedingly, for Kentuckians to understand that I am charging them with a purpose to inveigle me, and do violence to me. Yet I can not go into the newspapers. Would not the editor of the Herald, upon being shown this letter, insert the short correction, which you find upon the inclosed scrap?</p>
<p>Please try him, unless you perceive some sufficient reason to the contrary. In no event, let my name be publicly used. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN</p>
<p align="center"><span class="rend-b">CORRECTION</span></p>
<p>We have such assurance as satisfies us that our correspondent writing from Springfield, Ills, under date of Aug. 8--- was mistaken in representing Mr. Lincoln as expressing a suspicion of a design to inveigle him into Kentucky for the purpose of doing him violence.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;97</span>Mr. Lincoln neither entertains, nor has intended to express any such suspicion.</p>

<p>My dear Sir: A correspondent of the New-York Herald, who was here a week ago, writing to that paper, represents me as saying I had been invited to visit Kentucky, but that I suspected it was a trap to inveigle me into Kentucky, in order to do violence to me.</p>
<p>This is wholly a mistake. I said no such thing. I do not remember, but possibly I did mention my correspondence with you. But very certainly I was not guilty of stating, or insinuating, a suspicion of any intended violence, deception, or other wrong, against me, by you, or any other Kentuckian. Thinking this Herald correspondence might fall under your eye, I think it due to myself to enter my protest against the correctness of this part of it. I scarcely think the correspondent was malicious; but rather that he misunderstood what was said. Yours very truly</p>

Hon. T. Weed--- Springfield, Ills--- Aug. 17, 1860.</div>
<p>My dear Sir---Yours of the 13th. was received this morning. Douglas is managing the Bell-element with great adroitness. He<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;98</span>
had his men, in Kentucky, to vote for the Bell candidate, producing a result which has badly alarmed and damaged Breckinridge, and, at the same time, has induced the Bell men to suppose that Bell will certainly be President, if they can keep a few of the Northern States away from us, by throwing them to Douglas. But you, better than I, understand all this.</p>
<p>I think there will be the most extraordinary effort ever made, to carry New-York for Douglas. You, and all others who write me from your state, think the effort can not succeed; and I hope you are right; still it will require close watching, and great effort on the other side.</p>
<p>Herewith I send you a copy of a letter,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_98_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_98_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> written at New-York, which sufficiently explains itself, and which may, or may not, give you a valuable hint.</p>
<p>You have seen that Bell tickets have been put on the track, both here, and in Indiana. In both cases, the object has been, I think, the same as the Hunt<span class="ptr"><a name="4_98_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_98_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> movement in N.

My dear Sir: Aug. 24. 1860</div>
<p>Yours of the 23rd. is received. My recollection is that I never lived in the same neighborhood with Charles Hanks till I came to Macon county, Illinois, after I was twenty-one years of age. As I understand, he and I were born in different counties of Kentucky, and never saw each other in that State; that while I was a very small boy my father removed to Indiana, and your father with his family remained in Kentucky for many years. At length you, a young man grown, came to our neighborhood, and were at our house, off and on, a great deal for three, four, or five years; and during the time, your father, with his whole family, except William, Charles, and William Miller, who had married one of your sisters, came to the same neighborhood in Indiana, and remained a year or two, and then went to Illinois. William, Charles, and William Miller, had removed directly from Kentucky to Illinois, not even passing through our neighborhood in Indiana.</p>
<p>Once, a year or two before I came to Illinois, Charles, with some others, had been back to Kentucky, and returning to Illinois, passed through our neighborhood in Indiana. He stopped, I think, but one day, (certainly not as much as three); and this was the first time I ever saw him in my life, and the <span class="rend-i">only</span> time, till I came to Illinois, as before stated. The year I passed in Macon county I was with him a good deal---mostly on his own place, where I helped him at breaking prarie, with a joint team of his and ours, which in turn, broke some on the new place we were improving.</p>

Petersburg, Ills. Sep. 1860</div>
<p>Sir: A pamphlet, over name, bearing the title of ``Opposing principles of Henry Clay, and Abraham Lincoln'' is being circulated among the people. I quote from it as follows, towit:</p>
<p class="rend-large">SLAVERY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.</p>
<p>In 1837, as a member of the Illinois Legislature, Mr. LINCOLN, with only four others, voted against the following resolution:</p>
<p>``<span class="rend-i">Resolved</span>, That the Government cannot abolish slavery in the District of Columbia against the consent of the citizens of said District <span class="rend-i">without a manifest breach of good faith</span>.'' [See House Jour., 1836-7, p. 240.]</p>
<p>In Congress, at the session of 1848-49, he voted to institute measures for the abolition of slavery in the District. In 1839, in the Illinois Legislature, he voted against a resolution to the effect---</p>
<p>``That as the General Government cannot do, directly, what it is clearly prohibited from doing indirectly, that it is the openly declared design of the Abolitionist of this nation to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, with a view to its ultimate abolishment in the States;. . . . and that, therefore, Congress ought not to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia.'' [House Jour., 1838-9, p. 329.]<span class="ptr"><a name="4_104_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_104_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>It is seen in this that you arraign Mr. Lincoln, first, for a vote in the Illinois Legislature of 1836-7---secondly for a vote in Congress in 1848-9, and thirdly for a vote in the Illinois Legislature of 1839.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;105</span>As authority for the first arraignment, you say (``See House Jour. p 240''). Now, I have that Journal, at this moment open before me, at page 240--- and there is, upon that page, absolutely nothing upon that subject. But on pages 243 &amp; 244. there is a series of resolutions, four in number, the third of which is very nearly, but not quite, such as you set out. But they were not voted upon that day; on the contrary, as appears by the same Journal, at pages 248 &amp; 249, they were referred to a select committee. Seven days afterwards, as shown by the same Journal, at pages 309-310 &amp; 311. the committee reported the resolutions back to the House, with an amendment proposed to <span class="rend-i">each</span> one of them; which amendments were all adopted by the House; and then the series, as amended, passed the House by Yeas and Nays, Mr. Lincoln, and five others voting against them.</p>
<p>Now, the point is, John, that the Journal does not show in what <span class="rend-i">shape</span> any of those resolutions stood, when Mr. Lincoln voted against them. It does show that they were all amended---were all changed from their original form; but what new shape they took does nowhere appear in the Journal. And hence, John, in stating that Mr. Lincoln voted against a resolution, in the shape you alledge he did, you state what is almost certainly false, and certainly what you do not know to be true.</p>
<p>But, more than this, John: These resolutions went to the senate, and were passed by that body, as appears by the Senate Journal, of that session, at pages 277 &amp; 297. They were not spread upon the Senate Journal either, so that their substance and form remains entirely uncertain.</p>
<p>But again, John, Mr. Lincoln, with his colleague, Dan Stone, at the same session, and with reference to these identical resolutions, defined his position in relation to Slavery in the District of Columbia, by a written protest, entered upon the same Journal of the House of Representatives, at pages 817-818, and which entry and protest is as follows, towit.</p>
<p>The following protest was presented to the House which was read and ordered to be spread on the Journals, to-wit:</p>
<p>Resolutions upon the subject of domestic slavery having passed both branches of the General Assembly at its present session, the undersigned hereby protest against the passage of the same.</p>
<p>They believe that the institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy; but that the promulgation of abolition doctrines tend rather to increase than to abate its evils.</p>
<p>They believe that the Congress of the United States has no power, under the constitution to interfere with the institution of slavery in the different States.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;106</span>They believe that the Congress of the United States has the power under the constitution to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia; but that that power ought not to be exercised, unless at the request of the people of said District.</p>
<p>The difference between these opinions and those contained in the said resolutions, is their reason for entering this protest.</p>
<p>DAN. STONE</p>
<p>A. LINCOLN</p>
<p>Representatives from the County of Sangamon.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_106_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_106_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span></p>
<p>And now, John, we know you had these Journals in your hands---were ransacking them, and know of all these things---and yet you suppressed them. Why did you suppress them?</p>
<p>Your second arraignment of Mr. Lincoln is seen to be in these words, towit.</p>
<p>``In Congress, at the session of 1848-49 he voted to institute measures for the abolition of slavery in the District.''</p>
<p>For this arraignment, you refer to no authority whatever; and with the Congressional Globe, for that session, now before me, I venture to say Mr. Lincoln gave no such vote. At page 38 of that volume of the congressional Globe, I find that on the question of granting leave to Mr. Palfrey<span class="ptr"><a name="4_106_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_106_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[4]</a></span> to introduce a bill ``to repeal all acts, or parts of acts, of congress, establishing or maintaining slavery, or the slave-trade in the District of Columbia'' taken by yeas and nays, Mr. Lincoln voted <span class="rend-i">against</span> granting the leave. And further on, at page 55 &amp; 56 on the question of laying upon the table, a bill already before the House, ``to authorize the people of the District of Columbia to express their desires as to the existence of slavery therein'' taken by yeas and nays, Mr. Lincoln voted to lay the bill on the table. And these are the only instances of votes, on questions of abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia, being taken by yeas and nays, during that session.</p>
<p>You were not very prudent, John, in stating a falsehood in this instance: but you were as prudent as possible, under the circumstances, to quote no authority by which to prove it.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Lincoln gave no other <span class="rend-i">votes</span> on the question, it is true, that he drew up, and sought to get before the House of Representatives, at that session, a bill for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, upon the conditions that the abolition should be gradual, and only upon a vote of the majority of the people of the District, and with compensation to unwilling owners, and also embracing a fugitive slave clause, and an exception in<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;107</span>
favor of Officers of the Government, while in the District on the public business; all which appears in the same volume of the congressional Globe, at pages 212-244.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_107_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_107_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[5]</a></span></p>
<p>As to your third arraignment of Mr. Lincoln, referring to the Ills. House Journal of 1838-9. page 329, I find on pages 322 &amp; 323 of that Journal, that to a ``resolution from the Senate requiring the Engrossing clerks of the Senate and House, respectively to make out copies of memorials and resolutions to be transmitted to congress &amp;c.'' Mr. Calhoun (Candle-box)<span class="ptr"><a name="4_107_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_107_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[6]</a></span> offered, as an amendment, a long preamble, and five resolutions about slavery, one of which resolutions contains language substantially as you have quoted; that on motion, the preamble and resolutions were laid on the table by yeas and nays, shown at page 329-330---Mr. Lincoln voting to lay them on the table. Whether they were thus laid upon the table, with any reference to their <span class="rend-i">merits</span>, or because of their <span class="rend-i">incongruity</span>, as an amendment to a resolution from the Senate, prescribing the duty of the Engrossing clerks, fair minded men will judge; or, perhaps N. W. Edwards, now a Douglas man, and Gen. <span class="rend-i">W. F. Thornton</span>, one of the Douglas delegates to the late Charleston and Baltimore conventions can tell---they being two of the fortyfour who with Mr. Lincoln---voted to lay them on the table.</p>
<p>August 27. 1858. In his joint debate with Senator Douglas at Freeport, in answer to certain questions which had been propounded by Douglass, Mr. Lincoln said: ``The fourth one is in regard to slavery in the District of Columbia. In relation to that, I have my mind very distinctly made up. I should be exceedingly glad to see slavery abolished in the District of Columbia. I believe that congress possesses the constitutional power to abolish it. Yet as a member of congress I should not, with my present views, be in favor of endeavoring to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, unless it would be upon these conditions: <span class="rend-i">First</span>, that the abolition should be gradual. <span class="rend-i">Second</span>, that it should be on a vote of the<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;108</span>
majority of the qualified voters of the District; and <span class="rend-i">third</span> that compensation should be made to unwilling owners. With these three conditions, I confess I would be exceedingly glad to see congress abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, and, in the language of Henry Clay, ``sweep from the capitol that foul blot upon our nation.'' (<span class="rend-i">Joint Debates</span>, page 89---<span class="ptr"><a name="4_108_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_108_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[7]</a></span></p>

John's pamphlet was reprinted from a signed article printed in the <span class="rend-i">Missouri Republican</span>, July 24, 1860. Lincoln's letter seems not to have been completed or sent. Its manner suggests his intention that it be published or copied as a communication from some one else than himself, and the two fragments (<span class="rend-i">infra</span>) dealing with the charges made in Hill's pamphlet suggest that an article may have been prepared for publication in lieu of the letter. Lincoln's resentment of Hill's lack of respect for truth is all the more interesting in view of the fact that Hill became the prime source of the Ann Rutledge story, the tradition of Lincoln's infidelity, and a number of other spurious or dubious traditions concerning Lincoln's infidelity, and a number of other spurious or dubious traditions concerning Lincoln's New Salem years, when in the <span class="rend-i">Menard Axis</span>, February 15, 1862, he published an article entitled ``A Romance of Reality,'' composed largely of family gossip.

<p>The protest, before mentioned, placed on the Journal of the Illinois House of Representatives more than twenty three years ago; the draft of a bill, spread on the Congressional Globe more than eleven years ago; and his declaration in the Freeport debate not quite two years ago, are all in harmony with each other, and show conclusively what Mr. Lincoln's views are in regard to Slavery in the District of Columbia. They show that he thinks congress has the constitutional power to abolish it; and that the power might properly be exercised, <span class="rend-i">with</span> substantially such conditions as set out in the bill drawn by himself; and that it ought not to be exercised without such conditions.</p>
<p>The foregoing is the whole (excepting the report as indicated) which, after full examination, can be found on the subject of slavery, in the Journals of the Illinois Senate and House of Representatives, for the session of 1836-7.</p>
<p>It is seen that the <span class="rend-i">form</span> in which the resolutions passed, and were voted against by Mr. Lincoln, nowhere appears---the Journal showing that all of them were changed from the original form, by amendments, without showing what they were in the amended form.</p>
<p>Nor is this of the least consequence in determining Mr. Lincoln's views upon the subject, at that time; since, by the protest, he placed upon the same Journal, his own views upon the subject, in his own well considered language, which stand of record for the inspection of all who choose</p>

Dear Sir: Sept. 4. 1860</div>
<p>Yours of the 29th. is received; and I presume I understand what has prompted you to write it. In 1832 I was first a candidate for the Legislature, with some ten or a dozen other candidates. <span class="rend-i">Peter Cartwright</span>, and three others were elected, of whom I was <span class="rend-i">not</span> one. In 1834 he, and I, and several others, again become candidates; he declined before the election, I saw the race through, and, with three others, was elected. In 1835 he became a candidate to fill a vacancy in the State Senate, and his sole competitor, Job Fletcher, beat him by near six hundred majority.</p>
<p>In 1836, 1838, &amp; 1840, I was successively elected to the Legislature---he not being a candidate at either of those elections.</p>
<p>I then ceased to be a candidate for anything till 1846, when I ran for Congress. Mr. Cartwright was my competitor, and I beat him, as I recollect 1511 majority, being about double the party majority of the District.</p>
<p>I was never a candidate for congress at any other time, and never had any contest with Mr. Cartwright other than as I have stated.</p>

Your secretary of state,---Mr. Smith,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_110_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_110_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[4]</a></span> I think,---whom you introduced to me by letter, gave this assurance; more recently, Mr. Fessenden,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_110_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_110_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[5]</a></span> our candidate for Congress in one of those districts, wrote a relative here that his election was sure by at least five thousand, and that Washburne's majority would be from 14,000 to 17,000; and still later, Mr. Fogg, of New Hampshire, now at New York serving on a national committee, wrote me that we were having a desperate fight in Maine, which would end in a splendid victory for us.</p>
<p>Such a result as you seem to have predicted in Maine, in your letter to Colfax, would, I fear, put us on the down-hill track, lose us the State elections in Pennsylvania and Indiana, and probably ruin us on the main turn in November.</p>
<p>You must not allow it. Yours very truly, A. LINCOLN.</p>

My dear Sir Sep. 4. 1860</div>
<p>Yours of Aug. 30th. for some cause, only reached me last night. As to Pennsylvania, I have a letter from Gen. Cameron,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_110_7"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_110_7;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> dated Aug. 29th. in which, among other things, he says:</p>

<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;111</span>Last night, just as I had read your letter, Mr. David Taggart called upon me. He is a very intelligent gentleman, lately was Speaker of the Penn.

<p>What you say about the Northern 30 counties of Illinois pleases me. Keep good your promise that they will give as much majority as they did for Fremont, and we will let you off. We can not be beaten, nor even hard run, in the state, if that holds true. Yours as ever A. LINCOLN.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; Tracy, pp. 161-62. Anson G. Chester was editor of the Buffalo, New York, <span class="rend-i">Commercial Advertiser</span>. In 1864 he left journalism for a commission as major<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;112</span></p>
<p>and appointment as New York military agent at Buffalo, and in later life entered the Presbyterian ministry. His letter of September 1 is not in the Lincoln Papers. See the note, Lincoln to A. Chester, March 14, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>. The newspaper clipping was undoubtedly from the Chicago <span class="rend-i">Times and Herald</span>. The <span class="rend-i">Illinois State Journal</span>, September 6, 1860, denounced the forgery in the following article, which may have been written by Lincoln and was certainly authorized by him:</p>
<p>``In the Chicago <span class="rend-i">Times and Herald</span> of the 4th we find the following, purporting to be `a quotation from a speech made by Mr. Lincoln in 1844,' as taken from the <span class="rend-i">Macomb Eagle</span>:</p>
<p>`Mr. Jefferson is a statesman whose praises are never out of the mouths of the Democratic party. Let us attend to this uncompromising friend of freedom whose name is continually invoked against the Whig party. The character of Jefferson was repulsive. Continually puling about liberty, equality, and the degrading curse of slavery, he brought his own children to the hammer, and made money of his debaucheries. Even at his death he did not manumit his numerous offspring, but left them soul and body to degradation and the cart whip. A daughter of this vaunted champion of Democracy was sold some years ago at public auction in New Orleans, and purchased by a society of gentlemen, who wished to testify by her liberation their admiration of the statesman, who</p>
<p>``Dreamt of freedom in a slave's embrace.''</p>
<p>`This single line I have quoted gives more insight to the character of the man than whole volumes of panegyric. It will outlive his epitaph, write it who may.'</p>
<p>``This is a bold and deliberate forgery, whether originating with the Chicago <span class="rend-i">Times and Herald</span> or the Macomb <span class="rend-i">Eagle</span>. Mr. Lincoln never used any such language in any speech <span class="rend-i">at any time</span>. Throughout the whole of his political life, Mr. Lincoln has ever spoken of Mr. Jefferson in the most kindly and respectful manner, holding him up as one of the ablest statesmen of his own or any other age, and constantly referring to him as one of the greatest apostles of freedom and free labor. This is so well known that any attempt, by means of fraud or forgery, to create the contrary impression, can only react upon the desperate politicians who are parties to such disreputable tactics.''</p>

<p>Yours of the 17th. is just received.

He had four brothers---Isaac, Jacob, John &amp; Thomas. They were born in Pennsylvania, and my grand-father, and some, if not all the others, in early life removed to Rockingham Co. Virginia.

<p>Dear Doctor Yours of July 18th. was received some time ago. When you wrote, you had not learned the result of the Democratic conventions at Charleston &amp; [Ba]ltimore. With the two tickets in the field I should think it possible for our friends to carry Oregon. But the general result, I think, does not depend upon Oregon. No one, this side of the mountains, pretends that any ticket can be elected by the People, unless it be ours. Hence great efforts to combine against us, are being made, which, however, as yet, have not had much success.</p>
<p>Besides what we see in the newspapers, I have a good deal of private correspondence; and, without giving details, I will only say, it all looks very favorable to our success.</p>

<p>The ``Abraham Baldwin letter'' in substance was that I could not find the Journal of the Confederation Congress for the session at which was passed the Ordinance of 1787---and that in stating Mr. Baldwin had voted for its passage, I had relied on a communication<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;119</span>

<p>Your letter of July 22--- was received a few days ago. If your Father and Mother desire you to come home, it is a delicate matter for me to advise you not to do it. Still, as you ask my advice, it is that if you are doing well, you better stick to it. If you have a good start there, and should give it up, you might not get it again, here, or elsewhere. It can not be other than their first wish that you shall do well.</p>
<p>And now, as to politics, I am very much obliged to you for what you offer to do for me in Oregon. This side of the Rocky Mountains things appear reasonably well for the general result. In opposing David Logan, at the late congressional election in Oregon, I suppose you did what you thought was right; and when a man does what he thinks is right, he does the best he can. Still, I am sorry you did not think differently, as I knew David from his childhood, and he studied law in our office when his father and I were partners.</p>

<div class="opener">Louisville, Ky--- Sep. 29. 1860</div>
<p>Meeting &amp; Dialogue of Douglas &amp; Breckenridge---</p>
<p>DOUG--- Well, you have succeeded in breaking up the Democratic party.</p>
<p>BRECK--- Certainly, for the time being, the party is under a cloud, to say the least; but why you should say <span class="rend-i">I</span> did it, I do not comprehend.</p>
<p>DOUG--- Perhaps I should charge it to your <span class="rend-i">supporters</span>, rather than to <span class="rend-i">you</span>.</p>
<p>BRECK--- The blame, as I conceive, is neither upon my friends or me.</p>
<p>DOUG--- They insisted on having a plat-form, upon which <span class="rend-i">I</span> could not stand.</p>
<p>BRECK--- Aye, and <span class="rend-i">you</span> insisted on having a platform upon which <span class="rend-i">they</span> could not stand.</p>
<p>DOUG--- But <span class="rend-i">mine</span> was the true <span class="rend-i">Democratic</span> platform.</p>
<p>BRECK--- That presents the exact point in dispute; my friends insist that <span class="rend-i">theirs</span> is the true Democratic platform.</p>
<p>DOUG--- Let us argue it, then.</p>
<p>BRECK--- I conceive that argument is exhausted; <span class="rend-i">you</span> certainly could advance nothing new, and <span class="rend-i">I</span> know not that I could. There is, however, a colatteral point, upon which I would like the exchange of a few words.</p>
<p>DOUG--- What is it?</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;124</span>BRECK--- It is this: We insisted on Congressional protection of Slave property in the national teritories; and you broke with us professedly because of this.</p>
<p>DOUG--- Exactly so; I insisted upon non-intervention.</p>
<p>BRECK--- And yet you are forming coalitions, wherever you can, with Bell, who is for this very congressional protection of slavery---for the very thing which you pretend, drove you from us--- for Bell, with all his Know-Nothingism, and anti-democracy of every sort.</p>
<p>DOUG--- Bell is a good Union-man; and you, and your friends, are a set of disunionists.</p>
<p>BRECK--- Bah! You have known us long, and intimately; why did you never denounce us as disunionists, till since our refusal to support <span class="rend-i">you</span> for the Presidency? Why have you never warned the North against our disunion schemes, till since the Charleston and Baltimore sessions of the National convention? Will you answer, Senator Douglas?</p>
<p>DOUG--- The condition of my throat will not permit me to carry this conversation any further.</p>

<p>My dear Sir: To comply with your request to furnish extracts from my tariff speeches is simply impossible, because none of those speeches were published. It was not fashionable here in those days to report one's public speeches. In 1844 I was on the Clay electoral ticket in this State (<span class="rend-i">i.e.,</span> Illinois) and, to the best of my ability, sustained, together, the tariff of 1842 and the tariff plank of the Clay platform<span class="ptr"><a name="4_125_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_125_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span>. This could be proven by hundreds---perhaps thousands---of living witnesses; still it is not in print, except by inference. The Whig papers of those years all show that I was upon the electoral ticket; even though I made speeches, among other things <span class="rend-i">about</span> the tariff, but they do not show <span class="rend-i">what</span> I said about it. The papers show that I was one of a committee which reported, among others, a resolution in these words:</p>
<p>``That we are in favor of an adequate revenue on duties from imports so levied as to afford ample protection to American industry.''</p>
<p>But, after all, was it really any more than the tariff plank of our present platform? And does not my acceptance pledge me to that? And am I at liberty to do more, if I were inclined? Yours truly,</p>

<p>It is now less than three weeks to the election. For months we have been trying to get an unequivocal declaration from democratic newspaper's and democratic candidates for the Legislature, whether it is, or is not their purpose, at the next session, to release Gov Matteson from the payment of the money obtained by him through the canal script-fraud. But we have tried in vain. There is nothing left for us, but an appeal to the tax-payers. We say to them ``it is your business.'' By your votes you can hold him to it, or you can release him.'' ``Every year a part of the price of all you sell, from beef-cattle down to butter and eggs, is wrung from you in gold, to replenish a State Treasury'' ``To a certain extent, this is indispensable; but it is for you to say whether it shall be thus wrung from you to be litterally stolen, and applied to establishing banks, and building palaces for nabobs.'' ``Will you attend to it?''</p>
<p>Several years ago, the Auditor sold certain state lands, receiving therefor, as the law required, certain internal improvement script. This script was deposited with the then Governor, not being cancelled, or destroyed. Recently it has been discovered that a portion of this script has found it's way out of the Governor's custody, to New-York, where it has been funded and State bonds issued for it<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;129</span>
payable to <span class="rend-i">Peter O Strang</span>. Thus this script was once paid for with state lands, and then again with State bonds. But this is not the end. The bonds are brought to the Treasury here, and bought in with the gold of the tax-payers. One Lowe brings them and gets the gold for them. It turns out that the bonds are filled up in this Lowe's handwriting, and then transferred from <span class="rend-i">Peter O Strang</span> to Lowe, also in Lowe's handwriting. Who is <span class="rend-i">Peter O. Strang</span>, and how he got the script out of the Governor's custody, to treat it as his own, get State bonds for it, nobody seems to know. But this much is known. Matteson was Governor when the script <span class="rend-i">may</span> have gone from the executive custody, and Lowe was his agent at New-York, to fill up state bonds in rightful cases. Only a few days ago Lowe was in Springfield, and a suit was commenced against him for the money obtained from the State on the bonds. For a time the Sheriff could not find him; but at last he was found concealed in Matteson's house. And this too, after the Sheriff had been once turned away from the house, by Matteson himself.</p>

alarm? Is it that no interference by the government, with slaves or slavery within the states, is intended? I have said this so often already, that a repetition of it is but mockery, bearing an appearance of weakness, and cowardice, which perhaps should be avoided. Why do not uneasy men <span class="rend-i">read</span> what I have already said? and what our <span class="rend-i">platform</span> says? If they will not read, or heed, then [these?], would they read, or heed, a repetition of them? Of course the declaration that there is no intention to interfere with slaves or slavery, in the states, with all that is fairly implied in such declaration, is true; and I should have no objection to make, and repeat the declaration a thousand times, if there were no danger of encouraging bold bad men to believe they are dealing with one who can be scared into anything.</p>

Geo. D. Prentice, Esq Springfield, Ills. Oct. 29. 1860</div>
<p>My dear Sir: Yours of the 26th. is just received. Your suggestion that I, in a certain event, shall write a letter, setting forth my conservative views and intentions, is certainly a very worthy one. But would it do any good? If I were to labor a month, I could not express my conservative views and intentions more clearly and strongly, than they are expressed in our plat-form, and in my many speeches already in print, and before the public. And yet even you, who do occasionally speak of me in terms of personal kindness, give no prominence to these oft-repeated expressions of conservative views and intentions; but busy yourself with appeals to all conservative men, to vote for Douglas---to vote any way which can possibly defeat me---thus impressing your readers that you think, I am the very worst man living. If what I have already<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;135</span>
said has failed to convince you, no repetition of it would convince you. The writing of your letter, now before me, gives assurance that you would publish such a letter from me as you suggest; but, till now, what reason had I to suppose the Louisville Journal, even, would publish a <span class="rend-i">repe[ti]tion</span> of that which is already at it's command, and which it does not press upon the public attention?</p>
<p>And, now my friend---for such I esteem you personally---do not misunderstand me. I have not decided that I will not do substantially what you suggest. I will not forbear<span class="ptr"><a name="4_135_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_135_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> doing so, merely on <span class="rend-i">punctilio</span> and pluck. If I do finally abstain, it will be because of apprehension that it would do harm. For the good men of the South---and I regard the majority of them as such---I have no objection to repeat seventy and seven times. But I have <span class="rend-i">bad</span> men also to deal with, both North and South---men who are eager for something new upon which to base new misrepresentations---men who would like to frighten me, or, at least, to fix upon me the character of timidity and cowardice. They would seize upon almost any letter I could write, as being an ``<span class="rend-i">awful coming down</span>.'' I intend keeping my eye upon these gentlemen, and to not unnecessarily put any weapons in their hands. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN</p>

General Scott's memorandum ``Views suggested by the imminent danger of a disruption of the Union by the secession of one or more Southern States,'' October 29, 1860, gave his opinion that secession would lead to four confederacies, that Lincoln should point out the unprofitable nature of slavery in the western territories, that seizure of Southern forts would precede secession, that a policy of moderation and firmness for the next twelve months would perhaps prevent secession, and that although he had no political interests he preferred the Bell-Everett ticket (DLC-RTL).</p>

<p>I find Mr. Lincoln is not insensible to any uneasiness in the minds of candid men, nor to any commercial, or financial, depression, or disturbance, in the country if there be such; still he does not, so far as at present advised, deem it necessary, or proper for him to make, or authorize, any public declaration.

<p>First, I could say nothing which I have not already said, and which is in print, and open for the inspection of all. To press a repetition of this upon those who <span class="rend-i">have</span> listened, is useless; to press it upon those who have <span class="rend-i">refused</span> to listen, and still refuse, would be wanting in self-respect, and would have an appearance of sycophancy and timidity, which would excite the contempt of good men, and encourage bad ones to clamor the more loudly.</p>
<p>I am not insensible to any commercial or financial depression that may exist; but nothing is to be gained by fawning around the ``<span class="rend-i">respectable scoundrels</span>'' who got it up. Let them go to work and repair the mischief of their own making; and then perhaps they will be less greedy to do the like again. Yours very truly</p>

I beg you to believe me sincere when I declare I do not say this in a spirit of complaint or resentment; but that I urge it as the true cure for any real uneasiness in the country that my course may be other than conservative.

<p>I have labored in, and for, the Republican organization with entire confidence that whenever it shall be in power, each and all of the States will be left in as complete control of their own affairs respectively, and at as perfect liberty to choose, and employ, their own means of protecting property, and preserving peace and order within their respective limits, as they have ever been under any administration. Those who have voted for Mr. Lincoln, have expected, and still expect this; and they would not have voted for him had they expected otherwise. I regard it as extremely fortunate for the peace of the whole country, that this point, upon which the Republicans<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;142</span>

Nov. 20--- 1860.'' Although Lincoln felt constrained not to express publicly in his own person the assurance which so many of his correspondents were demanding, he undertook by means of Trumbull's speech to try the effect of a quasi-official statement of his views. That his anticipation of failure for the effort did not lessen his disappointment is indicated in his letter to Henry J. Raymond, November 28, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>.

When this is shown, a re-action will assuredly take place in favor of Republicanism, the Southern mind even will be satisfied, the rights of Northern men will be respected, and the fraternal feeling existing in olden times, when men from all parts of the country went forth together to battle for a common cause, against a common enemy, will be restored.''</p>

My dear Sir Nov. 28. 1860</div>
<p>Yours of the 14th. was received in due course. I have delayed so long to answer it, because my reasons for not coming before the<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;146</span>
public in any form just now, had substantially appeared in your paper (The Times), and hence I feared they were not deemed sufficient by you, else you would not have written me as you did.</p>
<p>I now think we have a demonstration in favor of my view. On the 20th. Inst. Senator Trumbull made a short speech which I suppose you have both seen and approved.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_146_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_146_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> Has a single newspaper, heretofore against us, urged that speech [upon its readers] with a purpose to quiet public anxiety? Not one, so far as I know. On the contrary the Boston Courier, and its' class, hold me responsible for the speech, and endeavor to inflame the North with the belief that it foreshadows an abandonment of Republican ground by the incoming administration; while the Washington Constitution, and its' class hold the same speech up to the South as an open declaration of war against them.</p>
<p>This is just as I expected, and just what would happen with any declaration I could make. These political fiends are not half sick enough yet. ``Party malice'' and not ``public good'' possesses them entirely. ``They seek a sign, and no sign shall be given them.'' At least such is my present feeling and purpose. [Yours very truly</p>

<p>``We are now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated, with the avowed object, and confident promise, of putting an end to slavery agitation. Under the operation of that policy, that agitation has not only not ceased, but has continually augmented. I believe it will not cease till a crisis shall have been reached and passed. A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved. I do not expect the house to fall; but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in course of ultimate extinction; or its advocates will push it forward till it will become alike lawful in all the States old as well as new---North as well as South.''</p>

Is it desired that I shall shift the ground upon which I have been elected? I can not do it. You need only to acquaint yourself with that ground, and press it on the attention of the South. It is all in print and easy of access. May I be pardoned if I ask whether even you have ever attempted to procure the reading of the Republican platform, or my speeches, by the Southern people? If not, what reason have I to expect that any additional production of mine would meet a better fate? It would<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;152</span>
make me appear as if I repented for the crime of having been elected, and was anxious to apologize and beg forgiveness. To so represent me, would be the principal use made of any letter I might now thrust upon the public. My old record cannot be so used; and that is precisely the reason that some new declaration is so much sought.</p>
<p>Now, my dear sir, be assured, that I am not questioning <span class="rend-i">your</span> candor; I am only pointing out, that, while a new letter would hurt the cause which I think a just one, you can quite as well effect every patriotic object with the old record. Carefully read pages 18, 19, 74, 75, 88, 89, &amp; 267 of the volume of Joint Debates between Senator Douglas and myself, with the Republican Platform adopted at Chicago, and all your questions will be substantially answered. I have no thought of recommending the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, nor the slave trade among the slave states, even on the conditions indicated; and if I were to make such recommendation, it is quite clear Congress would not follow it.</p>
<p>As to employing slaves in Arsenals and Dockyards, it is a thing I never thought of in my life, to my recollection, till I saw your letter; and I may say of it, precisely as I have said of the two points above.</p>
<p>As to the use of patronage in the slave states, where there are few or no Republicans, I do not expect to inquire for the politics of the appointee, or whether he does or not own slaves. I intend in that matter to accommodate the people in the several localities, if they themselves will allow me to accommodate them. In one word, I never have been, am not now, and probably never shall be, in a mood of harassing the people, either North or South.</p>
<p>On the territorial question,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_152_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_152_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> I am inflexible, as you see my position in the book. On that, there is a difference between you and us; and it is the only substantial difference. You think slavery is right and ought to be extended; we think it is wrong and ought to be restricted. For this, neither has any just occasion to be angry with the other.</p>
<p>As to the state laws, mentioned in your sixth question, I really know very little of them. I never have read one. If any of them are in conflict with the fugitive slave clause, or any other part of the constitution, I certainly should be glad of their repeal; but I could hardly be justified, as a citizen of Illinois, or as President of the United States, to recommend the repeal of a statute of Vermont, or South Carolina.</p>
<p>With the assurance of my highest regards I subscribe myself Your obt. Servt., A. LINCOLN</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;153</span>P.S. The documents referred to, I suppose you will readily find in Washington. A. L.</p>

Hon. Thurlow Weed Springfield, Ills- Dec. 17-1860</div>
<p>My dear Sir Yours of the 11th. was received two days ago. Should the convocation of Governors, of which you speak, seem desirous to know my views on the present aspect of things, tell them you judge from my speeches that I will be inflexible on the territorial question; that I probably think either the Missouri line extended, or Douglas' and Eli Thayer's Pop. Sov. would lose us every thing we gained by the election; that filibustering for all South of us, and making slave states of it, would follow in spite of us, under either plan.</p>
<p>Also, that I probably think all opposition, real and apparant, to the fugitive slave [clause] of the constitution ought to be withdrawn.</p>
<p>I believe you can pretend to find but little, if any thing, in my speeches, about secession; but my opinion is that no state can, in any way lawfully, get out of the Union, without the consent of the others; and that it is the duty of the President, and other government functionaries to run the machine as it is.

First. That the constitution should never be altered so as to authorize Congress to abolish or interfere with slavery in the states. This was accepted. Second. That the Fugitive slave law should be amended by granting a jury trial to the fugitive. . . . '' This was amended so as to name the jury from the state which the fugitive had fled, and was voted down by the Republicans. The third resolution --- that Congress should recommend that the states revise legislation concerning persons recently resident in the state and repeal all in conflict with the constitution --- was rejected. At another meeting on December 26, Seward continued, he had offered a fourth proposition to the effect that Congress should pass a law to prevent invasion of a state, which was amended and rejected. Whereupon the Republican members of the committee, together with Trumbull and Fessenden, met to consider Lincoln's resolutions: ``While we think the ground has already been covered we find that in the form you give it it would divide our friends not only in the Committee but in Congress, a portion being unwilling to give up their old opinion that the duty of executing the constitutional provisions concerning fugitives from service belongs to the States, and not at all to Congress.

Please present my respects to the General, and tell him, confidentially, I shall be obliged to him to be as well prepared as he can to either <span class="rend-i">hold</span>, or <span class="rend-i">retake</span>, the forts, as the case may require, at, and after the inaugeration.

<p>My dear Sir: I am much obliged by the receipt of yours of the 18th. The most we can do now is to watch events, and be as well prepared as possible for any turn things may take. If the forts fall, my judgment is that they are to be retaken. When I shall determine definitely my time of starting of Washington, I will notify you. Yours truly, A. LINCOLN.</p>

My dear Sir Dec. 22, 1860</div>
<p>Your obliging answer to my short note is just received, and for which please accept my thanks. I fully appreciate the present peril the country is in, and the weight of responsibility on me.</p>
<p>Do the people of the South really entertain fears that a Republican administration would, <span class="rend-i">directly, or indirectly</span>, interfere with their slaves, or with them, about their slaves? If they do, I wish to assure you, as once a friend, and still, I hope, not an enemy, that there is no cause for such fears.</p>
<p>The South would be in no more danger in this respect, than it was in the days of Washington. I suppose, however, this does not meet the case. You think slavery is <span class="rend-i">right</span> and ought to be extended; while we think it is <span class="rend-i">wrong</span> and ought to be restricted. That I suppose is the rub. It certainly is the only substantial difference between us. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>My dear Sir--- I do not desire any amendment of the Constitution. Recognizing, however, that questions of such amendment rightfully belong to the American People, I should not feel justified, nor inclined, to withhold from them, if I could, a fair opportunity of expressing their will thereon, through either of the modes prescribed in the instrument.</p>
<p>In addition I declare that the maintainance inviolate of the rights of the States, and especially the right of each state to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is essential to that balance of powers on which the perfection, and endurance of our political fabric depends ---and I denounce the lawless invasion, by armed force, of the soil of any State or Territory, no matter under what pretext, as the gravest of crimes.</p>
<p>I am greatly averse to writing anything for the public at this time; and I consent to the publication of this, only upon the condition that six of the twelve United States Senators for the States of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida, and Texas shall sign their names to what is written on this sheet below my name, and allow the whole to be published together.

<p>All this is not the result of accident. It has a philosophical cause. Without the <span class="rend-i">Constitution</span> and the <span class="rend-i">Union</span>, we could not have attained<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;169</span>
the result; but even these, are not the primary cause of our great prosperity. There is something back of these, entwining itself more closely about the human heart. That something, is the principle of ``Liberty to all'' ---the principle that clears the <span class="rend-i">path</span> for all---gives <span class="rend-i">hope</span> to all --- and, by consequence, <span class="rend-i">enterprize</span>, and <span class="rend-i">industry</span> to all.</p>
<p>The <span class="rend-i">expression</span> of that principle, in our Declaration of Independence, was most happy, and fortunate. <span class="rend-i">Without</span> this, as well as <span class="rend-i">with</span> it, we could have declared our independence of Great Britain; but <span class="rend-i">without</span> it, we could not, I think, have secured our free government, and consequent prosperity. No oppressed, people will <span class="rend-i">fight</span>, and <span class="rend-i">endure</span>, as our fathers did, without the promise of something better, than a mere change of masters.</p>
<p>The assertion of that <span class="rend-i">principle</span>, at <span class="rend-i">that time</span>, was <span class="rend-i">the</span> word, ``<span class="rend-i">fitly spoken</span>'' which has proved an ``apple of gold'' to us. The <span class="rend-i">Union</span>, and the <span class="rend-i">Constitution</span>, are the <span class="rend-i">picture</span> of <span class="rend-i">silver</span>, subsequently framed around it. The picture was made, not to <span class="rend-i">conceal</span>, or <span class="rend-i">destroy</span> the apple; but to <span class="rend-i">adorn</span>, and <span class="rend-i">preserve</span> it. The <span class="rend-i">picture</span> was made <span class="rend-i">for</span> the apple --- <span class="rend-i">not</span> the apple for the picture.</p>
<p>So let us act, that neither <span class="rend-i">picture</span>, or <span class="rend-i">apple</span> shall ever be blurred, or bruised or broken.</p>
<p>That we may so act, we must study, and understand the points of danger.</p>

<p>My dear Sir: Yours without signature was received last night. I have been considering your suggestions as to my reaching Washington somewhat earlier than is usual. It seems to me the inaugeration is not the most dangerous point for us. Our adversaries have us more clearly at disadvantage, on the second Wednesday of February, when the votes should be officially counted. If the two Houses refuse to meet at all, or meet without a quorum of each, where shall we be? I do not think that this counting is constitutionally essential to the election; but how are we to proceed in absence of it?</p>
<p>In view of this, I think it is best for me not to attempt appearing in Washington till the result of that ceremony is known.</p>
<p>It certainly would be of some advantage if you could know who are to be at the heads of the War and Navy Departments; but until I can ascertain definitely whether I can get any suitable men from the South? and who?. and how many? I can not well decide. As yet, I have no word from Mr. Gilmer, in answer to my request for an interview with him. I look for something on the subject, through you, before long. Yours very truly A.

Hon. Lyman Trumbull Springfield, Ills.<br>
My dear Sir Jan. 7. 1861</div>
<p>Yours of the 3rd. is just received. The democrats of our H.R. refused to make a quorum today, trying, as I understand, to prevent your re-election. I trust that before this reaches you, the telegraph will have informed you that they have failed, and you have triumphed.</p>
<p>Gen. C. has not been offered the Treasury, and, I think, will not be. It seems to me not only highly proper, but a <span class="rend-i">necessity</span>, that Gov. Chase shall take that place. His ability, firmness, and purity of character, produce the propriety; and that he alone can reconcile Mr. Bryant, and his class, to the appointment of Gov. S. to the State Department produces the necessity. But then comes the danger that the protectionists of Pennsylvania will be dissatisfied; and, to clear this difficulty, Gen. C. must be brought to co-operate. He would readily do this for the War Department. But then comes the fierce opposition to his having any Department, threatening even to send charges into the Senate to procure his rejection by that body. Now, what I would most like, and what I think he should prefer too, under the circumstances, would be to retain his place in the Senate; and if that place has been promised to another, let that other take a respectable, and reasonably lucrative place abroad. Also let Gen. C's friends be, with entire fairness, cared for in Pennsylvania, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>I may mention before closing that besides the very fierce opposition to Gen. C. he is more amply recommended for a place in the cabinet, than any other man.</p>
<p>I have a great notion to post Judd fully in this matter, and get him to visit Washington, and in his quiet way, try to adjust it satisfactorily. Yours as ever A. LINCOLN.</p>

<p>My dear Sir---Yours of the 6th is received. I answer it only because I fear you would misconstrue my silence. What is our present condition? We have just carried an election on principles fairly stated to the people. Now we are told in advance, the government shall be broken up, unless we surrender to those we have beaten, before we take the offices. In this they are either attempting to play upon us, or they are in dead earnest. Either way, if we surrender, it is the end of us, and of the government. They will repeat the experiment upon us <span class="rend-i">ad libitum</span>. A year will not pass, till we shall have to take Cuba as a condition upon which they will stay in the Union. They now have the Constitution, under which we have lived over seventy years, and acts of Congress of their own framing, with no prospect of their being changed; and they can never have a more shallow pretext for breaking up the government, or extorting a compromise, than now. There is, in my judgment, but one compromise which would really settle the slavery question, and that would be a prohibition against acquiring any more territory. Yours very truly, A. LINCOLN.</p>

<p>My dear Sir: Jan. 3. 1861</p>
<p>When you were here about the last of December, I handed you a letter saying I should at the proper time, nominate you to the Senate for a place in the cabinet. It is due to you, and to truth, for me to say you were here by my invitation, and not upon any suggestion of your own. You have not, as yet, signified to me, whether you would accept the appointment; and, with much pain, I now say to you, that you will relieve me from great embarrassment by allowing me to recall the offer. This springs from an unexpected complication; and not from any change of my view as to the ability or faithfulness with which you would discharge the duties of the place.</p>
<p>I now think I will not definitely fix upon any appointment for Pennsylvania until I reach Washington. Your Obt. Servt.</p>
<p>A. LINCOLN.</p>

<p>I learn from a gentleman who had an interview with Mr. Lincoln, at Springfield, within the past week that the latter in discussing the existing state of affairs expressed himself as follows:</p>
<p>---``I will suffer death before I will consent or will advise my friends to consent to any concession or compromise which looks like<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;176</span>
buying the privilege of taking possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right; because, whatever I might think of the merit of the various propositions before Congress, I should regard any concession in the face of menace the destruction of the government itself, and a consent on all hands that our system shall be brought down to a level with the existing disorganized state of affairs in Mexico. But this thing will hereafter be as it is now, in the hands of the people; and if they desire to call a Convention to remove any grievances complained of, or to give new guarantees for the permanence of vested rights, it is not mine to oppose.''</p>

<p>``Yes, I know who you allude to---Gen. CAMERON. This subject has already engaged a large share of my attention, and I have every reason to hope that your wishes will be gratified. I feel a<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;180</span>
strong desire to do something for your big State, and I am determined she shall be satisfied, if I can do it.''</p>
<p>The resolutions were read to him, when he continued, nearly in this language:</p>
<p>``Gentlemen, in the formation of my Cabinet, I shall aim as nearly as possible at perfection. Any man whom I may appoint to such a position, must be, as far as possible, like Caesar's wife, pure and above suspicion, of unblemished reputation, and undoubted integrity. I have already appointed Senator SEWARD and Mr. BATES, of Missouri, and they are men whose characters I think the breath of calumny cannot impeach. In regard to Gen. CAMERON, I have received assurances without limit from gentlemen whose word is entitled to credit, that he is eminently fitted for the position which his friends desire him to fill, and that his appointment would give great satisfaction to Pennsylvania. I have a great desire to appoint Gen. CAMERON, for the reason that he was formerly a Democrat, and I wish to give that element a fair representation in the distribution of the offices. Both Mr. SEWARD and Mr. BATES were formerly old line Whigs, and, for this reason, I feel a disposition to appoint Gen. CAMERON. But on the other hand, there is a strong opposition to him; not from his own State, it is true, for the opposition to him there is so slight that it is scarcely worth mentioning. The feeling against him appears to come from Ohio, and one or two of the other Western States. His opponents charge him with corruption in obtaining contracts, and contend that if he is appointed he will use the patronage of his office for his own private gain. I have no knowledge of the acts charged against him, but I intend to make an investigation of the whole matter, by allowing his opponents to submit their proof, and I shall give him an opportunity of explaining any part he may have had in the transactions alleged against him. For my own part, I can see no impropriety in his taking contracts, or making money out of them, as that is mere matter of business. There is nothing wrong in this, unless some unfairness or dishonesty is shown, which supposition I have no doubt Gen. CAMERON will be able to disprove. I shall deal fairly with him, but I say to you, gentlemen, frankly, that if the charges against him are proven, he cannot have a seat in my Cabinet, as I will not have any man associated with me whose character is impeached. I will say further, that if he vindicates himself, I have the strongest desire to place him in the position you wish him to fill, and which you think the interests of your State demand. If, after he has been appointed, I should be deceived by subsequent transactions of a disreputable character, the <span class="rend-i">responsibility will rest</span><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;181</span><span class="rend-i">upon you gentlemen of Pennsylvania who have so strongly presented his claims to my consideration</span>.

Hon. W. H. Seward Springfield, Ills. Feb. 1. 1861</div>
<p>My dear Sir On the 21st. ult. Hon. W. Kellogg, a Republican M.C of this state whom you probably know, was here, in a good deal of anxiety, seeking to ascertain to what extent I would be consenting for our friends to go in the way of compromise on the now vexed question. While he was with me I received a despatch from Senator Trumbull, at Washington, alluding to the same question, and telling me to await letters. I thereupon told Mr. Kellogg that when I should receive these letters, posting me as to the state of affairs at Washington, I would write you, requesting you to let him see my letter. To my surprise when the letters mentioned by Judge Trumbull came, they made no allusion to the ``vexed question'' This baffled me so much that I was near not writing you at all, in compliance with what I had said to Judge Kellogg.</p>
<p>I say now, however, as I have all the while said, that on the territorial question---that is, the question of extending slavery under the national auspices,---I am inflexible. I am for no compromise which <span class="rend-i">assists</span> or <span class="rend-i">permits</span> the extension of the institution on soil owned by the nation. And any trick by which the nation is to acquire territory, and then allow some local authority to spread slavery over it, is as obnoxious as any other.</p>
<p>I take it that to effect some such result as this, and to put us again on the high-road to a slave empire is the object of all these proposed compromises. I am against it.</p>
<p>As to fugitive slaves, District of Columbia, slave trade among the slave states, and whatever springs of necessity from the fact that the institution is amongst us, I care but little, so that what is done be comely, and not altogether outrageous. Nor do I care much about New-Mexico, if further extension were hedged against. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN---</p>

<p>My dear Sir. I have both your letter to myself, and that to Judge Davis, in relation to a certain gentleman in your state claiming to dispense patronage in my name, and also to be authorized to use my name to advance the chances of Mr. Greely for an election to the U.S. Senate. It is very strange that such things should be said by any one. The gentleman you mention, did speak to me of Mr. Greely, in connection with the Senatorial election, and I replied in terms of kindness towards Mr. Greely which I really feel, but always with an express protest that my name <span class="rend-i">must</span> not be used in the Senatorial election, in favor of, or against any one. Any other representation of me, is a misrepresentation.</p>
<p>As to the matter of dispensing patronage, it perhaps will surprise you to learn, that I have information that <span class="rend-i">you</span> claim to have my authority to arrange that matter in N.Y. I do not believe you have so claimed; but still so some men say. On that subject you know all I have said to you is ``justice to all,'' and I beg you to believe I have said nothing more particular to any one. I say this to re-assure you that I have not changed my purpose; in the hope however, that you will not use my name in the matter. Yours truly</p>

<p>My friends---No one, not in my situation, can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this parting. To this place, and the kindness of these people, I owe every thing.

Without the assistance of that Divine Being, who ever attended him, I cannot succeed. With that assistance I cannot fail.

To His care commending you, as I hope in your prayers you will commend me, I bid you an affectionate farewell</p>

<p>My Friends:</p>
<p>No one not in my position can appreciate the sadness I feel at this parting. To this people I owe all that I am. Here I have lived more than a quarter of a century; here my children were born, and here one of them lies buried. I know not how soon I shall see you again. A duty devolves upon me which is, perhaps, greater than that which has devolved upon any other man since the days of Washington. He never would have succeeded except for the aid of Divine Providence, upon which he at all times relied. I feel that I cannot succeed without the same Divine aid which sustained him, and on the same Almighty Being I place my reliance for support, and I hope you, my friends, will all pray that I may receive that Divine assistance without which I cannot succeed, but with which success is certain. Again I bid you an affectionate farewell.</p>

<p>Friends,</p>
<p>No one who has never been placed in a like position, can understand my feelings at this hour, nor the oppressive sadness I feel at this parting. For more than a quarter of a century I have lived among you, and during all that time I have received nothing but kindness at your hands. Here I have lived from my youth until now I am an old man. Here the most sacred ties of earth were assumed; here all my children were born; and here one of them lies buried. To you, dear friends, I owe all that I have, all that I am.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;191</span>All the strange, chequered past seems to crowd now upon my mind. To-day I leave you; I go to assume a task more difficult than that which devolved upon General Washington. Unless the great God who assisted him, shall be with and aid me, I must fail. But if the same omniscient mind, and Almighty arm that directed and protected him, shall guide and support me, I shall not fail, I shall succeed. Let us all pray that the God of our fathers may not forsake us now. To him I commend you all---permit me to ask that with equal security and faith, you all will invoke His wisdom and guidance for me. With these few words I must leave you---for how long I know not. Friends, one and all, I must now bid you an affectionate farewell.</p>

Henry Villard's story that he at one time had the pencilled manuscript and lost it, may or may not be true.

<p>FELLOW CITIZENS:---We have seen great changes within the recollection of some of us who are the older. When I first came to the west, some 44 or 45 years ago, at sundown you had completed a journey of some 30 miles which you had commenced at sunrise, and thought you had done well. Now only six hours have elapsed since I left my home in Illinois where I was surrounded by a large concourse of my fellow citizens, almost all of whom I could recognize, and I find myself far from home surrounded by the thousands I now see before me, who are strangers to me. Still we are bound together, I trust in christianity, civilization and patriotism, and are attached to our country and our whole country. While some of us may differ in political opinions, still we are all united in one feeling for the Union. We all believe in the maintainance of the Union, of every star and every stripe of the glorious flag, and permit me to express the sentiment that upon the union of the States, there shall be between us no difference. My friends, I meet many friends at every place on my journey, and I should weary myself should I talk at length, therefore permit me to bid you an affectionate farewell.</p>

<p>At Thorntown he was betrayed into an anecdote to illustrate a point, and the train started before he got to the place where the<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;193</span>
laugh came in, and the people were left to wonder what the meaning might be. He was apologizing for not making a speech. He had heard of a man who was a candidate for a county office, who owned a horse that he set great store by, but he was a slow animal and sure footed. He had canvassed extensively with a good chance for the nomination. On the morning of the day of the convention, he mounted his favorite to go to the county seat, but in spite of whip and spur, his horse lagged on the road, biting at every bush, and when he arrived late in the evening, the convention was over and he was defeated. So of him, if he stopped at every station to make a stump speech he would not arrive at Washington until the inauguration was over. The Thorntown folks only heard the first part of the story, where the candidate was urging his steed to pass the juicy bushes. He laughed over the cutting short of his yarn, and when the train arrived at Lebanon he was jocularly told that some of the Thorntown folks had followed the train on foot, and were panting outside to hear the conclusion of the story. He told it over good-humoredly to the crowd at Lebanon. Every station along the road had its crowd---all anxious to see the man whose election to the first office in the gift of a free people has been the cause (whether with reason or not) of the distracted state of the country.</p>

<p>It is not possible, in my journey to the national capital, to address assemblies like this which may do me the great honor to meet me as you have done, but very briefly. I should be entirely worn out if I were to attempt it. I appear before you now to thank you for this very magnificent welcome which you have given me, and still more for the very generous support which your State recently<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;195</span>
gave to the political cause of the whole country, and the whole world. [Applause.] Solomon has said, that there is a time to keep silence. [Renewed and deafening applause.] * * * * *<span class="ptr"><a name="4_195_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_195_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> We know certain that they mean the same thing while using the same words now, and it perhaps would be as well if they would keep silence.</p>
<p>The words ``coercion'' and ``invasion'' are in great use about these days. Suppose we were simply to try if we can, and ascertain what, is the meaning of these words. Let us get, if we can, the exact definitions of these words---not from dictionaries, but from the men who constantly repeat them---what things they mean to express by the words. What, then, is ``coercion''? What is ``invasion''? Would the marching of an army into South California, for instance, without the consent of her people, and in hostility against them, be coercion or invasion? I very frankly say, I think it would be invasion, and it would be coercion too, if the people of that country were forced to submit. But if the Government, for instance, but simply insists upon holding its own forts, or retaking those forts which belong to it,---[cheers,]---or the enforcement of the laws of the United States in the collection of duties upon foreign importations,---[renewed cheers,]---or even the withdrawal of the mails from those portions of the country where the mails themselves are habitually violated; would any or all of these things be coercion? Do the lovers of the Union contend that they will resist coercion or invasion of any State, understanding that any or all of these would be coercing or invading a State? If they do, then it occurs to me that the means for the preservation of the Union they so greatly love, in their own estimation, is of a very thin and airy character. [Applause.] If sick, they would consider the little pills of the homeopathist as already too large for them to swallow. In their view, the Union, as a family relation, would not be anything like a regular marriage at all, but only as a sort of free-love arrangement,---[laughter,]---to be maintained on what that sect calls passionate attraction. [Continued laughter.] But, my friends, enough of this.</p>
<p>What is the particular sacredness of a State? I speak not of that position which is given to a State in and by the Constitution of the United States, for that all of us agree to---we abide by; but that position assumed, that a State can carry with it out of the Union that which it holds in sacredness by virtue of its connection with the Union. I am speaking of that assumed right of a State, as a primary principle, that the Constitution should rule all that is less than itself, and ruin all that is bigger than itself. [Laughter.] But,</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;196</span>I ask, wherein does consist that right? If a State, in one instance, and a county in another, should be equal in extent of territory, and equal in the number of people, wherein is that State any better than the county? Can a change of name change the right? By what principle of original right is it that one-fiftieth or one-ninetieth of a great nation, by calling themselves a State, have the right to break up and ruin that nation as a matter of original principle? Now, I ask the question---I am not deciding anything---[laughter,]---and with the request that you will think somewhat upon that subject and decide for yourselves, if you choose, when you get ready,---where is the mysterious, original right, from principle, for a certain district of country with inhabitants, by merely being called a State, to play tyrant over all its own citizens, and deny the authority of everything greater than itself. [Laughter.] I say I am deciding nothing, but simply giving something for you to reflect upon; and, with having said this much, and having declared, in the start, that I will make no long speeches, I thank you again for this magnificent welcome, and bid you an affectionate farewell. [Cheers.]</p>

<p>My fellow-countrymen. You call upon me for a speech; I have none to give to you, and have not sufficient time to devote to it if I had. I suppose you are all Union men here, (cheers and cries of ``Right'') and I suppose that you are in favor of doing full justice to all, whether on that side of the river (pointing to the Kentucky shore), or on your own. (Loud cheering and cries of ``We are.'') If the politicians and leaders of parties were as true as the PEOPLE, there would be little fear that the peace of the country would be disturbed. I have been selected to fill an important office for a brief period, and am now, in your eyes, invested with an influence which will soon pass away; but should my administration prove to be a very wicked one, or what is more probable, a very foolish one, if you, the PEOPLE, are but true to yourselves and to the Constitution, there is but little harm I can do, <span class="rend-i">thank God</span>!</p>

<p>Mr. Mayor, ladies and gentlemen: Twenty-four hours ago, at the Capital of Indiana, I said to myself I have never seen so many people assembled together in winter weather. I am no longer able to say that. But it is what might reasonably have been expected---that this great city of Cincinnati would thus acquit herself on such an occasion. My friends, I am entirely overwhelmed by the magnificence of the reception which has been given, I will not say to<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;198</span>
me, but to the President elect of the United States of America. [Loud cheering.] Most heartily do I thank you, one and all for it. [Applause.]</p>
<p>I am reminded by the address of your worthy Mayor, that this reception is given not by any one political party, and even if I had not been so reminded by His Honor I could not have failed to know the fact by the extent of the multitude I see before me now. I could not look upon this vast assemblage without being made aware that all parties were united in this reception. [Applause.] This is as it should be. It is as it should have been if Senator Douglas had been elected. It is as it should have been if Mr. Bell had been elected---as it should have been if Mr. Breckinridge had been elected---as it should ever be when any citizen of the United States is constitutionally elected President of the United States. (Great applause.) Allow me to say that I think what has occurred here to-day could not have occurred in any other country on the face of the globe, without the influence of the free institutions which we have unceasingly enjoyed for three-quarters of a century. (Applause.) There is no country where the people can turn out and enjoy this day precisely as they please, save under the benign influence of the free institutions of our land. [Applause.]</p>
<p>I hope that, although we have some threatening National difficulties now---I hope that while these free institutions shall continue to be in the enjoyment of millions of free people of the United States, we will see repeated every four years what we now witness. [Applause.]</p>
<p>In a few short years, I and every other individual man who is now living will pass away. I hope that our national difficulties will also pass away, and I hope we shall see in the streets of Cincinnati---good old Cincinnati---for centuries to come, once every four years her people give such a reception as this to the constitutionally elected President of the whole United States. [Applause.] I hope you shall all join in that reception, and that you shall also welcome your brethren far across the river to participate in it. We will welcome them in every State of the Union, no matter where they are from. From away South we shall extend them a cordial good will when our present differences shall have been forgotten and blown to the winds forever. [Applause.]</p>
<p>I<span class="ptr"><a name="4_198_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_198_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> have spoken but once, before this, in Cincinnati. That was a year previous to the late Presidential election. On that occasion, in a playful manner, but with sincere words, I addressed much of what I said, to the Kentuckians. I gave my opinion that we, as Republicans, would ultimately beat them as democrats; but<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;199</span>
that they could postpone that result longer by nominating Senator Douglas for the Presidency than they could in any other way. They did not, in any true sense of the word, nominate Douglas, and the result has come certainly as soon as even I expected. I also told them how I expected they would be treated, after they should have been beaten; and I now wish to re-call their attention to what I then said upon that subject. I then said: ``When we do, as we say, beat you, you perhaps want to know what we will do with you. I will tell you, so far as I am authorized to speak for the opposition, what we mean to do with you. We mean to treat you, as near as we possibly can, as Washington, Jefferson, and Madison treated you. We mean to leave you alone, and in no way to interfere with your institution; to abide by all and every compromise of the constitution, and, in a word, coming back to the original proposition, to treat you, so far as degenerated men (if we have degenerated) may, according to the examples of those noble fathers---Washington, Jefferson and Madison. We mean to remember that you are as good as we; that there is no difference between us, other than the difference of circumstances. We mean to recognize, and bear in mind always, that you have as good hearts in your bosoms as other people, or as we claim to have, and treat you accordingly.''</p>
<p>Fellow citizens of Kentucky---friends---bretheren, may I call you---in my new position, I see no occasion, and feel no inclination, to retract a word of this. [Applause.] If it shall not be made good, be assured, the fault shall not be mine. [Applause.]</p>
<p>And now, fellow citizens of Ohio, have you, who agree with him who now addresses you, in political sentiment---have you ever entertained other sentiments towards our brethren of Kentucky than those I have expressed to you. [Loud and continued cries of ``No.''] If not, then why shall we not, as heretofore, be recognized and acknowledged as brethren again, living in peace and harmony one with another? [Cries of ``We will.''] I take your response as the most reliable evidence that it may be so, along with other evidence, trusting that the good sense of the American people, on all sides of all rivers in America, under the Providence of God, who has never deserted us, that we shall again be brethren, forgetting all parties---ignoring all parties. My friends I now bid you farewell. [Long continued applause.]</p>

<div class="opener">[c. February 12, 1861]</div>
<p>I am grateful, for the oppertunity your invitation affords me to appear before an audience of my native state. During the present winter it has been greatly pressed upon me by many patriotic citizens, Kentuckians among others, that I could in my position, by a word, restore peace to the country. But what word? I have many words already before the public; and my position was given me on the faith of those words. Is the desired word to be confirmatory of these; or must it be contradictory to them? If the former, it is useless repe[ti]tion; if the latter, it is dishonorable and treacherous.</p>
<p>Again, it is urged as if the word must be spoken before the fourth of March. Why? Is the speaking the word a ``<span class="rend-i">sine qua non</span>'' to the inaugeration? Is there a Bell-man, a Breckinridge-man, or a Douglas man, who would tolerate his own candidate to make such terms, had he been elected? Who amongst you would not die by the proposition, that your candidate, being elected, should be inaugerated, solely on the conditions of the constitution, and laws, or not at all. What Kentuckian, worthy of his birth place, would not do this? Gentlemen, I too, am a Kentuckian.</p>
<p>Nor is this a matter of mere personal honor<span class="ptr"><a name="4_200_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_200_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span>. No man can be elected President without some opponents, as well as supporters; and if when elected, he can not be installed, till he first appeases his enemies, by breaking his pledges, and and [<span class="rend-i">sic</span>] betraying his friends, this government, and all popular government, is already at an end. Demands for such surrender, once recognized, and yielded to, are without limit, as to nature, extent, or repetition. They break the only bond of faith between public, and public servant; and they distinctly set the minority over the majority. Such demands acquiesced in, would not merely be the ruin of a man, or a party; but as a precedent they would ruin the government itself.</p>
<p>I do not deny the possibility that the people may err in an election; but if they do, the true [remedy] is in the next election, and not in the treachery of the person elected.</p>
<p>During<span class="ptr"><a name="4_200_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_200_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> the winter just closed, I have been greatly urged, by many patriotic men, to lend the influence of my position to some compromise, by which I was, to some extent, to shift the ground<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;201</span>
upon which I had been elected. This I steadily refused. I so refused, not from any party wantonness, nor from any indifference to the troubles of the country. I thought such refusal was demanded by the view that if, when a Chief Magistrate is constitutionally elected, he cannot be inaugurated till he betrays those who elected him, by breaking his pledges, and surrendering to those who tried and failed to defeat him at the polls, this government and all popular government is already at an end. Demands for such surrender, once recognized, are without limit, as to nature, extent and repetition. They break the only bond of faith between public and public servant; and they distinctly set the minority over the majority.</p>
<p>I presume there is not a man in America, (and there ought not to be one) who opposed my election, who would, for a moment, tolerate his own candidate in such surrender, had he been successful in the election. In such case they would all see, that such surrender would not be merely the ruin of a man, or a party; but, as a precedent, would be the ruin of the government itself.</p>
<p>I do not deny the possibility that the people may err in an election; but if they do, the true cure is in the next election; and not in the treachery of the party elected.</p>

<p>MR. CHAIRMAN: I thank you and those whom you represent, for the compliment you have paid me, by tendering me this address. In so far as there is an allusion to our present national difficulties, which expresses, as you have said, the views of the gentlemen present, I shall have to beg pardon for not entering fully upon the questions, which the address you have now read, suggests.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;202</span>I deem it my duty---a duty which I owe to my constituents---to you, gentlemen, that I should wait until the last moment, for a development of the present national difficulties, before I express myself decidedly what course I shall pursue. I hope, then, not to be false to anything that you have to expect of me.</p>
<p>I agree with you, Mr. Chairman, that the working men are the basis of all governments, for the plain reason that they are the most numerous, and as you added that those were the sentiments of the gentlemen present, representing not only the working class, but citizens of other callings than those of the mechanic, I am happy to concur with you in these sentiments, not only of the native born citizens, but also of the Germans and foreigners from other countries.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, I hold that while man exists, it is his duty to improve not only his own condition, but to assist in ameliorating mankind; and therefore, without entering upon the details of the question, I will simply say, that I am for those means which will give the greatest good to the greatest number.</p>
<p>In regard to the Homestead Law, I have to say that in so far as the Government lands can be disposed of, I am in favor of cutting up the wild lands into parcels, so that every poor man may have a home.</p>
<p>In regard to the Germans and foreigners, I esteem them no better than other people, nor any worse. [Cries of good.] It is not my nature, when I see a people borne down by the weight of their shackles---the oppression of tyranny---to make their life more bitter by heaping upon them greater burdens; but rather would I do all in my power to raise the yoke, than to add anything that would tend to crush them.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as our country is extensive and new, and the countries of Europe are densely populated, if there are any abroad who desire to make this the land of their adoption, it is not in my heart to throw aught in their way, to prevent them from coming to the United States.</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman, and Gentlemen, I will bid you an affectionate farewell.</p>
<p>[<span class="rend-i">Gazette</span> Version]</p>
<p>Mr. Chairman: I thank you and those you represent, for the compliment paid me by the tender of this address. In so far as there is an allusion to our present national difficulties, and the suggestion of the views of the gentlemen who present this address, I beg you will excuse me from entering particularly upon it. I deem it due to myself and the whole country, in the present extraordinary<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;203</span>
condition of the country and of public opinion, that I should wait and see the last development of public opinion before I give my views or express myself at the time of the inauguration. [Cheers.] I hope at that time to be false to nothing you have been taught to expect of me. [Cheers.]</p>
<p>I agree with you, Mr. Chairman, and with the address of your constituents, in the declaration that working men are the basis of all governments. That remark is due to them more than to any other class, for the reason that there are more of them than of any other class. And as your address is presented to me not only on behalf of workingmen, but especially of Germans, I may say a word as to classes. I hold the value of life is to improve one's condition. Whatever is calculated to advance the condition of the honest, struggling laboring man, so far as my judgment will enable me to judge of a correct thing. I am for that thing.</p>
<p>An allusion has been made to the Homestead Law. I think it worthy of consideration, and that the wild lands of the country should be distributed so that every man should have the means and opportunity of benefitting his condition. [Cheers.] I have said I do not desire to enter into details, nor will I.</p>
<p>In regard to Germans and foreigners, I esteem foreigners no better than other people, nor any worse. [Laughter and cheers.] They are all of the great family of men, and if there is one shackle upon any of them, it would be far better to lift the load from them than to pile additional loads upon them. [Cheers.] And inasmuch as the continent of America is comparatively a new country, and the other countries of the world are old countries, there is more room here, comparatively speaking, than there is there; and if they can better their condition by leaving their old homes, there is nothing in my heart to forbid them coming; and I bid them all God speed. [Cheers.]</p>
<p>Again, gentlemen, thanking you for your address, I bid you good night.</p>

<p>MR. PRESIDENT AND MR. SPEAKER AND GENTLEMEN OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY:---It is true, as has been said by the President of the Senate, that very great responsibility rests upon me in the position to which the votes of the American people have called me. I am deeply sensible of that weighty responsibility. I cannot but know what you all know, that, without a name, perhaps without a reason why I should have a name, there has fallen upon me a task such as did not rest even upon the Father of his country, and so feeling I cannot but turn and look for the support without which it will be impossible for me to perform that great task. I turn, then, and look to the American people and to that God who has never forsaken them. Allusion has been made to the interest felt in relation to the policy of the new administration. In this I have received from some a degree of credit for having kept silence, and from others some deprecation. I still think that I was right. In the varying and repeatedly shifting scenes of the present, and without a precedent which could enable me to judge by the past, it has seemed fitting that before speaking upon the difficulties of the country, I should have gained a view of the whole field, to be sure, after all, being at liberty to modify and change the course of policy, as future events may make a change necessary. I have not maintained silence from any want of real anxiety. It is a good thing that there is no more than anxiety, for there is nothing going wrong. It is a consoling circumstance that when we look out there is nothing that really hurts anybody. We entertain different views upon political questions, but nobody is suffering anything. This is a most consoling circumstance, and from it we may conclude that all we want is time, patience and a reliance on that God who has never forsaken this people. Fellow citizens, what I have<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;205</span>
said, I have said altogether extemporaneously, and I will now come to a close.</p>

<p>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:---I appear before you only to address you briefly. I shall do little else than to thank you for this very kind reception, to greet you and bid you farewell. I should not find strength, if I were otherwise inclined, to repeat speeches of very great length, upon every occasion similar to this---although few so large---which will occur on my way to the Federal Capitol. The General Assembly of the great State of Ohio has just done me the honor to receive me, and to hear a few broken remarks from myself. Judging from what I see, I infer that that reception was one without party distinction, and one of entire kindness---one that had nothing in it beyond a feeling of the citizenship of the United States of America. Knowing, as I do, that any crowd, drawn together as this has been, is made up of the citizens near about, and that in this country of Franklin there is great difference of political sentiment, and those agreeing with me having a little the shortest row, (laughter,) from this, and the circumstances I have mentioned, I infer that you do me the honor to meet me here without distinction of party. I think this is as it should be. Many of you who were not favorable to the election of myself to the Presidency were favorable to the election of the distinguished Senator from the State in which I reside. If Senator Douglas had been elected to the Presidency in the late contest, I think my friends would have joined heartily in meeting and greeting him on his passage through your Capital, as you have me to-day. If any of the other candidates had been elected, I think it would have been altogether becoming and proper for all to have joined in showing honor, quite as well to the office, and the country, as to the man. The people are themselves honored by such a concentration. I am doubly thankful that you have appeared here to give me this greeting. It is not much to me, for I shall very soon pass away from you; but we have a large country and a large future before us, and the manifestations of good-will towards the government, and affection for the Union which you may exhibit are of immense<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;206</span>
value to you and your posterity forever. (Applause.) In this point of view it is that I thank you most heartily for the exhibition you have given me, and with this allow me to bid you an affectionate farewell. (Deafening applause and cheers.)</p>

<p>After the tumult had subsided he spoke a few words to the people, thanking them for their kind reception, and stated that there were a great many stopping places between his home and Washington, and if he stopped at every one he would not get to Washington until after the Inauguration and that would not suit him. He had but time to thank them heartily for this kind and cordial farewell, when he was ushered into the dining room of the Parks House . . . .</p>
<p>. . . . After dinner, Mr. Lincoln appeared on the platform of the car, and told the people that he could not make a speech, ``as he was too full for utterance,'' but if they had time they would organize the train, and pass a vote of thanks to the people of Harrison County for the excellent dinner they had received, and especially to the lady of the house.</p>

<p><span class="rend-i">Mr. Chairman and Fellow-Citizens:</span>---The subject of the short address which has been made to me, though not an unfamiliar one, involves so many points, that in the short time allotted to<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;207</span></p>
<p>me, I shall not be able to make a full and proper response. Though the people have made me by electing me, the instrument to carry out the wishes expressed in the address, I greatly fear that I shall not be the repository of the ability to do so. Indeed I know I shall not, more than in purpose, unless sustained by the great body of the people, and by the Divine Power, without whose aid we can do nothing. We everywhere express devotion to the Constitution. I believe there is no difference in this respect, whether on this or on the other side of this majestic stream. I understand that on the other side, among our dissatisfied brethren, they are satisfied with the Constitution of the United States, if they can have their rights under the Constitution. The question is, as to what the Constitution means---``What are their rights under the Constitution?'' That is all. To decide that, who shall be the judge? Can you think of any other, than the voice of the people? If the majority does not control, the minority must---would that be right? Would that be just or generous? Assuredly not! Though the majority may be wrong, and I will not undertake to say that they were not wrong in electing me, yet we must adhere to the principle that the majority shall rule. By your Constitution you have another chance in four years. No great harm can be done by us in that time---in that time there can be nobody hurt. If anything goes wrong, however, and you find you have made a mistake, elect a better man next time. There are plenty of them.</p>
<p>(Here the Engine whistled.) These points involve the discussion of many questions which I have not time to consider. I merely give them to you for your reflection. I almost regret that I alluded to it at all.</p>
<p>Ladies, gentlemen and friends, I thank you for this kind and overwhelming reception, and bid you farewell.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln came out on the hind platform of the rear car and, after the cheering had ceased, said that he made his appearance merely to pass a word of greeting, and then to bid farewell, as he said he had been informed that the train would halt just a minute and a half, consequently he would not be able to make a speech even if he were prepared to do so; that if he should make a speech at every station stopped at, he would not be able to reach Washington until after the 4th of March. Here some old, drunken chap<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;208</span>
rushed up with his paw extended, and asked if he would shake hands with him, saying at the same time, that he had not voted for him but for Douglas---a sad representative by the way---of Douglas Democracy. Mr. Lincoln shook hands with him and said if he and the other friends of Mr. Douglas would assist in keeping the ship of state afloat, that perhaps Mr. Douglas might be selected to pilot it sometime in the future, but if it were allowed to go to pieces now, Mr. Douglas would, of course, stand no chance hereafter. He said he would do what he could to preserve the Union and if the people would do the same, the thing would be accomplished.</p>

He was now on his way to Washington, and about the 4th of March he would speak to all who chose to hear him. A voice in the crowd enquired ``What will you do with the secessionists then?''

<p><span class="rend-i">Fellow Citizens:</span> We had an accident upon the road to-day, and were delayed till this late hour. I am sorry for this, inasmuch as it was my desire and intention to address the citizens of Pennsylvania, briefly, this evening, on what is properly styled their peculiar interest. And I still hope that some arrangement may be made to-morrow morning which will afford me the pleasure of talking to a larger number of my friends than can assemble in this hall. [``Go on now; there's enough here.''] I have a great regard for Allegheny county. It is ``the banner county of the Union,'' [cheers,] and rolled up an immense majority for what I, at least, consider a good cause. By a mere accident, and not through<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;209</span></p>
<p>any merit of mine, it happened that I was the representative of that cause, and I acknowledge with all sincerity the high honor you have conferred on me. [``Three cheers for Honest Abe,'' and a voice saying, ``It was no accident that elected you, but your own merits, and the worth of the cause.''] I thank you, my fellow citizen, for your kind remark, and trust that I feel a becoming sense of the responsibility resting upon me. [``We know you do.'']</p>
<p>I could not help thinking, my friends, as I traveled in the rain through your crowded streets, on my way here, that if all that people were in favor of the Union, it can certainly be in no great danger---it will be preserved. [A voice---``We are all Union men.'' Another voice---``That's so.'' A third voice---``No compromise.'' A fourth---``Three cheers for the Union.''] But I am talking too long, longer than I ought. [``Oh, no! go on; split another rail.'' Laughter.] You know that it has not been my custom, since I started on the route to Washington, to make long speeches; I am rather inclined to silence, [``That's right''] and whether that be wise or not, it is at least more unusual now-a-days to find a man who can hold his tongue than to find one who cannot. [Laughter, and a voice---``No <span class="rend-i">railery</span> Abe.''] I thank you, sincerely, for the warm reception I have received, and in the morning, if an arrangement can be made, of which I am not yet certain, I may have something to say to you of that ``peculiar interest of Pennsylvania'' before mentioned. [``Say it now, we are all attention.''] Well, my friends, as it is not much I have to say, and as there may be some uncertainty of another opportunity, I will utter it now, if you will permit me to procure a few notes that are in my overcoat pocket. [``Certainly we will,'' and cheers.]<span class="ptr"><a name="4_209_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_209_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="rend-b">Speech at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania<span class="ptr"><a name="4_210_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_210_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[1]</a></span></span></h2>
<div class="textindentlevelx">
<div class="opener">February 15, 1861</div>
<p><span class="rend-i">Mayor Wilson and Citizens of Pennsylvania</span>: I most cordially thank his Honor Mayor Wilson, and the citizens of Pittsburg generally for this flattering reception. It is<span class="ptr"><a name="4_210_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_210_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> the more grateful, because I know that, while it is not given to me alone, but to the cause which I represent, yet it is given under circumstances which clearly prove to me that there is good will and sincere feeling at the bottom of it.</p>
<p>And here, fellow citizens, I may remark that in every short address I have made to the people, and in every crowd through which I have passed of late, some allusion has been made to the present distracted condition of the country. It is naturally expected that I should say something upon this subject, but to touch upon it all would involve an elaborate discussion of a great many questions and circumstances, would require more time than I can at present command, and would perhaps unnecessarily commit me upon matters which have not yet fully developed themselves. [Immense cheering, and cries of ``good!'' ``that's right!'']</p>
<p>The condition of the country, fellow-citizens, is an extraordinary one, and fills the mind of every patriot with anxiety and solicitude. My intention is to give this subject all the consideration which I possibly can before I speak fully and definitely in regard to it---so that, when I do speak, I may be as nearly right as possible. And when I do speak, fellow-citizens, I hope to say nothing in opposition to the spirit of the Consititution, contrary to the integrity of the Union, or which will in any way prove inimical to the liberties of the people or to the peace of the whole country. And, furthermore,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;211</span>
when the time arrives for me to speak on this great subject, I hope to say nothing which will disappoint the reasonable expectations of any man, or disappoint the people generally throughout the country, especially if their expectations have been based upon anything which I may have heretofore said.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the troubles across the river, [the speaker pointing southwardly, and smiling] there is really no crisis, springing from anything in the government itself. In plain words, there is really no crisis except an <span class="rend-i">artificial one</span>! What is there now to warrant the condition of affairs presented by our friends ``over the river?'' Take even their own view of the questions involved, and there is nothing to justify the course which they are pursuing. I repeat it, then---<span class="rend-i">there is no crisis</span>, excepting such a one as may be gotten up at any time by designing politicians.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_211_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_211_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> My advice, then, under such circumstances, is to keep cool. If the great American people will only keep their temper, on both sides of the line, the troubles will come to an end, and the question which now distracts the country will be settled just as surely as all other difficulties of like character which have originated in this government have been adjusted. Let the people on both sides keep their self-possession, and just as other clouds have cleared away in due time, so will this, and this great nation shall continue to prosper as heretofore. But, fellow citizens, I have spoken longer on this subject than I had intended in the outset---and I shall say no more at present.</p>
<p>Fellow citizens, as this is the first opportunity<span class="ptr"><a name="4_211_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_211_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[4]</a></span> which I have had to address a Pennsylvania assemblage, it seems a fitting time to indulge in a few remarks upon the important question of a tariff---a subject of great magnitude, and one which is attended with many difficulties, owing to the great variety of interests which it involves. So long as direct taxation for the support of government is not resorted to, a tariff is necessary. The tariff is to the government what a meal is to the family; but, while this is admitted, it still becomes necessary to modify and change its operations according to new interests and new circumstances. So far there is little difference of opinion among politicians, but the question as to how far imposts may be adjusted for the protection of home industry, gives rise to various views and objections. I must confess that I do not understand this subject in all its multiform bearings, but I promise you that I will give it my closest attention, and endeavor to comprehend it more fully. And here I may remark that the Chicago<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;212</span>
platform contains a plank upon this subject, which I think should be regarded as law for the incoming administration. In fact, this question, as well as all other subjects embodied in that platform, should not be varied from what we gave the people to understand would be our policy when we obtained their votes. Permit me, fellow citizens, to read the tariff plank of the Chicago platform, or rather, to have it read in your hearing by one who has younger eyes than I have.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln's private Secretary then read section twelfth of the Chicago platform, as follows:</p>
<p>That, while providing revenue for the support of the General Government by duties upon imposts, sound policy requires such an adjustment of the imposts as to encourage the development of the industrial interest of the whole country, and we commend that policy of national exchanges which secures to the working men liberal wages, to agriculture remunerating prices, to mechanics and manufacturers an adequate reward for their skill, labor and enterprise, and to the nation commercial prosperity and independence.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln continued---Now, fellow-citizens, I must confess that there are shades of difference in construing even this plank of the platform. But I am not now intending to discuss these differences, but merely to give you some general ideas upon this subject. I have long thought that if there be any article of necessity which can be produced at home with as little or nearly the same labor as abroad, it would be better to protect that article. Labor is the true standard of value. If a bar of iron, got out of the mines of England, and a bar of iron taken from the mines of Pennsylvania, be produced at the same cost, it follows that if the English bar be shipped from Manchester to Pittsburg, and the American bar from Pittsburg to Manchester, the cost of carriage is appreciably lost. [Laughter.] If we had no iron here, then we should encourage its shipment from foreign countries; but not when we can make it as cheaply in our own country. This brings us back to our first proposition, that if any article can be produced at home with nearly the same cost as abroad, the carriage is lost labor.</p>
<p>The treasury of the nation is in such a low condition at present that this subject now demands the attention of Congress, and will demand the immediate consideration of the new Administration. The tariff bill now before Congress may or may not pass at the present session. I confess I do not understand the precise provisions of this bill, and I do not know whether it can be passed by the present Congress or not. It may or may not become the law of the land---but if it does, that will be an end of the matter until a modification<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;213</span>
can be effected, should it be deemed necessary. If it does not pass (and the latest advices I have are to the effect that it is still pending) the next Congress will have to give it their earliest attention.</p>
<p>According to my political education, I am inclined to believe that the people in the various sections of the country should have their own views carried out through their representatives in Congress, and if the consideration of the Tariff bill should be postponed until the next session of the National Legislature, no subject should engage your representatives more closely than that of a tariff. And if I have any recommendation to make, it will be that every man who is called upon to serve the people in a representative capacity, should study this whole subject thoroughly, as I intend to do myself, looking to all the varied interests of our common country, so that when the time for action arrives adequate protection can be extended to the coal and iron of Pennsylvania, the corn of Illinois, and the ``reapers of Chicago.'' Permit me to express the hope that this important subject may receive such consideration at the hands of your representatives, that the interests of no part of the country may be overlooked, but that all sections may share in common the benefits of a just and equitable tariff. [Applause.]</p>
<p>But I am trespassing upon your patience---[cries of ``no!'' ``no!'' ``Go on---we'll listen!''] and must bring my remarks to a close. Thanking you most cordially for the kind reception which you have extended me, I bid you all adieu. [Enthusiastic applause.]</p>
<p>[Manuscript Prepared for the Pittsburgh Speech]<span class="ptr"><a name="4_213_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_213_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[5]</a></span></p>
<p>For the first time I now have the honor to appear before a Pennsylvania audience.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_213_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_213_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[6]</a></span></p>
<p>It is often said that the tariff is the specialty of Pennsylvania. Assuming that direct taxation is not to be adopted, the tariff question must be as durable as the government itself. It is a question of national house-keeping. It is to the government what replenishing the meal-tub is to the family. Ever-varying circumstances will require frequent modifications, as to amounts needed, and sources of supply. So far there is little difference of opinion among the people. It is as to whether, and how far, duties on imports, shall be adjusted to favor home production in the home market, that controversy begins. One party insists that such adjustment oppresses one class for the advantage of another; while the other party argues<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;214</span>
that with all its incidents, and in the long run, all classes are benefitted. In the Chicago Platform there is a plank upon this subject, which should be a general law, to the incoming administration. We should do neither more nor less than we gave the people reason to believe we would, when they gave us their votes. That plank is as I now read.</p>
<p>[The 12th plank of the Chicago platform was here read.]<span class="ptr"><a name="4_214_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_214_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[7]</a></span></p>
<p>As with all general propositions, doubtless there will be shades of difference in construing this. I have, by no means, a thoroughly matured judgment upon this subject---especially as to details. Some general ideas are about all. I have long thought that to produce any necessary article at home, which can be made of as good quality, and with as little labor at home as abroad, would better be made at home, at least by the difference of the carrying from abroad. In such case, the carrying is demonstrably a dead loss of labor. For instance, labor being the true standard of value, is it not plain, that if equal labor get a bar of rail-road iron out of a mine in England, and another out of a mine in Pennsylvania, each can be laid down in a track at home, cheaper than they could exchange countries, at least by the cost of carriage. If there be a present cause why one can be both made and carried, cheaper, in <span class="rend-i">money price</span>, than the other can be made without carrying, that cause is an unnatural, and injurious one, and ought, gradually, if not rapidly, to be removed.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_214_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_214_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[8]</a></span></p>
<p>The condition of the Treasury at this time would seem to render an early revision of the tariff indispensable. The Morrill bill, now pending before congress, may, or may not become a law. I am not posted as to it's particular provisions; but if they are generally satisfactory, and the bill shall now pass, there will be an end for the present. If, however, it shall not pass, I suppose the whole subject will be one of the most pressing and important, for the next congress. By the constitution, the executive may recommend measures which he may think proper; and he may veto those he thinks improper; and it is supposed he may add to these, certain indirect influences to affect the action of congress. My political education strongly inclines me against a very free use of any of these means, by the Executive, to control the legislation of the country. As a rule, I think it better that congress should originate, as well as perfect its measures, without external bias. I therefore would rather recommend to every gentleman who knows he is to<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;215</span>
be a member of the next congress, to take an enlarged view, and post himself thoroughly so as to contribute his part to such an adjustment of the tariff, as shall produce a sufficient revenue, and in in [<span class="rend-i">sic</span>] its other bearings, so far as possible, be just and equal to all sections of the country &amp; classes of the people.</p>

<p>MR. CHAIRMAN AND FELLOW CITIZENS OF CLEVELAND:---We have been marching about two miles through snow, rain and deep mud. The large numbers that have turned out under these circumstances testify that you are in earnest about something or other. But do I think so meanly of you as to suppose that that earnestness is about me personally? I would be doing you injustice to suppose you did. You have assembled to testify your respect to the Union, the constitution and the laws, and here let me say that it is with you, the people, to advance the great cause of the Union and the constitution, and not with any one man. It rests with you alone. This fact is strongly impressed on my mind at present. In a community like this, whose appearance testifies to their intelligence, I am convinced that the cause of liberty and the Union can never be in danger. Frequent allusion is made to the excitement at present existing in our national politics, and it is as well that I should also allude to it here. I think that there is no occasion for any excitement. The crisis, as it is called, is altogether an artificial crisis. In all parts of the nation there are differences of opinion and politics. There are differences of opinion even here. You did not all vote for the person who now addresses you. What is happening now will not hurt those who are farther away from here. Have they not all their rights now as they ever have had? Do they not have<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;216</span>
their fugitive slaves returned now as ever? Have they not the same constitution that they have lived under for seventy odd years? Have they not a position as citizens of this common country, and have we any power to change that position? (Cries of ``No.'') What then is the matter with them? Why all this excitement? Why all these complaints? As I said before, this crisis is all artificial. It has no foundation in facts. It was not argued up, as the saying is, and cannot, therefore, be argued down. Let it alone and it will go down of itself (Laughter). Mr. Lincoln said they must be content with but a few words from him. He was very much fatigued, and had spoken so frequently that he was already hoarse. He thanked them for the cordial and magnificent reception they had given him. Not less did he thank them for the votes they gave him last fall, and quite as much he thanked them for the efficient aid they had given the cause which he represented---a cause which he would say was a good one. He had one more word to say. He was given to understand that this reception was not tendered by his own party supporters, but by men of all parties. This is as it should be. If Judge Douglas had been elected and had been here on his way to Washington, as I am to-night, the republicans should have joined his supporters in welcoming him, just as his friends have joined with mine to-night. If all do not join now to save the good old ship of the Union this voyage nobody will have a chance to pilot her on another voyage. He concluded by thanking all present for the devotion they have shown to the cause of the Union.</p>

<p>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:---I appear before you merely to greet you and say farewell. I have no time for long speeches, and could not make them at every stopping place without wearing myself out. If I should make a speech at every town, I should not get to Washington until some time <span class="rend-i">after the inauguration</span>. (Laughter.) I am, however, all the time sensible of the deepest gratitude to the people of Ohio for their large contribution to the cause which I think is the just one. There are doubtless those here who did not vote for me, but I believe we make common cause for the Union (``That's so.'' ``We are with you there,'' &amp;c.) But let me tell to those who did not vote for me, an anecdote of a certain Irish friend that I met yesterday. He said he did not vote for me, but went for Douglas. ``Now,'' said I to him, ``I will tell you what you ought to do in that case. If we all turn in and keep the ship from sinking this voyage, there may be a chance for Douglas on the next; but if we let it go down now, neither he nor anybody else will have an opportunity of sailing in it again.'' Now, was not that good advice? (``Yes, yes,'' ``that's the talk.'') Once more, let me say good-bye.</p>

Some three months ago, I received a letter from a young lady here; it was a very pretty letter, and she advised me to let my whiskers grow, as it would improve my personal appearance; acting partly upon her suggestion, I have done so; and now, if she is here, I would like to see her; I think her name was Miss BARLLY.''<span class="ptr"><a name="4_219_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_219_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> A small boy, mounted on a post, with his mouth and eyes both wide open, cried out, ``there she is, Mr. LINCOLN,'' pointing to a beautiful girl, with black eyes, who was blushing all over her fair face.

<p>Mr. Mayor, and Fellow Citizens of Buffalo and the State of New York:---I am here to thank you briefly for this grand reception given to me, not personally, but as the representative of our great and beloved country. (Cheers.) Your worthy Mayor has been pleased to mention in his address to me, the fortunate and agreeable journey which I have had from home, on my rather circuitous route to the Federal Capital. I am very happy that he was enabled in truth to congratulate myself and companions [company] on that fact. It is true we have had nothing, thus far, to mar the pleasure of the trip. We have not been met alone by those who assisted in giving the election to me---I say not alone---but by the whole population of the country through which we have passed. This is as it should be.</p>
<p>Had the election fallen to any other of the distinguished candidates instead of myself, under the peculiar circumstances, to say the least, it would have been proper for all citizens to have greeted him as you now greet me. It is evidence of the devotion of the whole people to the Constitution, the Union, and the perpetuity of the liberties of this country. (Cheers.) I am unwilling, on any occasion, that I should be so meanly thought of, as to have it supposed for a moment that I regard these demonstrations as tendered to me personally. They should be tendered to no individual man. They are tendered to the country, to the institutions of the country, and to the perpetuity of the [liberties of the] country for which these institutions were made and created.</p>
<p>Your worthy Mayor has thought fit to express the hope that I may be able to relieve the country from its present---or I should say, its threatened difficulties. I am sure I bring a heart true to the work. (Tremendous applause.) For the ability to perform it, I must trust in that Supreme Being who has never forsaken this<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;221</span>
favored land, through the instrumentality of this great and intelligent people. Without that assistance I shall surely fail. With it I cannot fail.</p>
<p>When we speak of threatened difficulties to the country, it is natural that there should be expected from me something with regard to particular measures. Upon more mature reflection, however, others will agree with me that when it is considered that these difficulties are without precedent, and have never been acted upon by any individual situated as I am, it is most proper I should wait, see the developments, and get all the light I can, so that when I do speak authoritatively I may be as near right as possible. (Cheers.) When I shall speak authoritatively, I hope to say nothing inconsistent with the Constitution, the Union, the rights of all the States, of each State, and of each section of the country, and not to disappoint the reasonable expectations of those who have confided to me their votes.</p>
<p>In this connection allow me to say that you, as a portion of the great American people, need only to maintain your composure. Stand up to your sober convictions of right, to your obligations to the Constitution, act in accordance with those sober convictions, and the clouds which now arise in the horizon will be dispelled, and we shall have a bright and glorious future; and when this generation has passed away, tens of thousands will inhabit this country where only thousands inhabit [it] now.</p>
<p>I do not propose to address you at length---I have no voice for it. Allow me again to thank you for this magnificent reception, and bid you farewell.</p>

I have no speech to make, and no sufficient time to make one if I had; nor have I the strength to repeat a speech, at all the places at which I stop, even if all the other circumstances were favorable. I have come to see you and allow you to see me (Applause) and in this so far [as] regards the Ladies, I have the best of the bargain on my side. I don't make that acknowledgement to the gentlemen, (Increased laughter) and now I believe I have really made my speech and am ready to bid you farewell when the cars move on.</p>

You are all here to see and to be seen, but where there are so many assembled he thought that he obtained the best view. And now he must bid them all farewell as the train would soon start.

<p>Mr. GOVERNOR---I was pleased to receive an invitation to visit the capital of the great Empire State of this nation on my way to<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;225</span>
the federal capital, and I now thank you, Mr. Governor, and the people of this capital and the people of the State of New York, for this most hearty and magnificent welcome. If I am not at fault, the great Empire State at this time contains a greater population than did the United States of America at the time she achieved her national independence. I am proud to be invited to pass through your capital and meet them, as I now have the honor to do. I am notified by your Governor that this reception is given without distinction of party. I accept it more gladly because it is so. Almost all men in this country, and in any country where freedom of thought is tolerated, attach themselves to political parties. It is but ordinary charity to attribute this to the fact that in so attaching himself to the party which his judgment prefers, the citizen believes he thereby promotes the best interests of the whole country; and when an election is passed, it is altogether befitting a free people, that until the next election, they should be as one people. The reception you have extended to me to-day is not given to me personally. It should not be so, but as the representative for the time being of the majority of the nation. If the election had resulted in the selection of either of the other candidates, the same cordiality should have been extended him, as is extended to me this day, in their testimony of the devotion of the whole people to the Constitution and to the whole Union, and of their desire to perpetuate our institutions, and to hand them down in their perfection to succeeding generations. I have neither the voice nor the strength to address you at any greater length. I beg you will accept my most grateful thanks for this devotion, not to me, but to this great and glorious free country.</p>

<p>MR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN OF THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK: It is with feelings of great diffidence, and I may say with feelings of awe, perhaps greater than I have recently experienced, that I meet you here in this place. The history of this great State, the renown of those great men who have stood here, and spoke here, and been heard here, all crowd around my fancy, and incline me to shrink from any attempt to address you.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;226</span>Yet I have some confidence given me by the generous manner in which you have invited me, and by the still more generous manner in which you have received me to speak further. You have invited and received me without distinction of party. I cannot for a moment suppose that this has been done in any considerable degree with reference to my personal services, but that it is done in so far as I am regarded at this time as the representative of the majesty [majority] of this great nation. I doubt not this is the truth and the whole truth of the case, and this is as it should be. It is much more gratifying to me that this reception has been given to me as the representative of a free people than it could possibly be if tendered me [merely] as an evidence of devotion to me, or to any one man personally, and now I think it were more fitting that I should close these hasty remarks. It is true that while I hold myself without mock modesty, the humblest of all individuals that have ever been elevated to the Presidency, I have a more difficult task to perform than any one of them. You have generously tendered me the united support of the great Empire State. For this, in behalf of the nation, in behalf of the present and future of the nation, in behalf of the civil and religious liberty for all time to come, most gratefully do I thank you. I do not propose to enter into an explanation of any particular line of policy as to our present difficulties to be adopted by the incoming administration. I deem it just to you, to myself and to all that I should see everything, that I should hear everything, that I should have every light that can be brought within my reach, in order that when I do so speak, I shall have enjoyed every opportunity to take correct and true ground; and for this reason I don't propose to speak at this time of the policy of the Government; but when the time comes I shall speak as well as I am able for the good of the present and future of this country---for the good both of the North and the South of this country---for the good of the one and the other, and of all sections of the country. [Rounds of applause.] In the mean time, if we have patience; if we restrain ourselves; if we allow ourselves not to run off in a passion, I still have confidence that the Almighty, the Maker of the Universe will, through the instrumentality of this great and intelligent people, bring us through this as He has through all the other difficulties of our country. Relying on this, I again thank you for this generous reception. [Applause and cheers.]</p>

<p>Mr. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN:---I am rather an old man to avail myself of such an excuse as I am now about to do, yet the truth is so distinct and presses itself so distinctly upon me that I cannot well avoid it, and that is that I did not understand when I was brought into this room that I was brought here to make a speech. It was not intimated to me that I was brought into the room where Daniel Webster and Henry Clay had made speeches,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_230_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_230_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> and where one in my position might be expected to do something like those men, or do something unworthy of myself or my audience. I therefore will beg you to make very great allowance for the circumstances under which I have been by surprise brought before you. Now, I have been in the habit of thinking and speaking for some time upon political questions that have for some years past agitated the country, and if I were disposed to do so, and we could take up some one of the issues as the lawyers call them, and I were called upon to make an argument about it to the best of my ability, I could do that without much preparation. But that is not what you desire to be done here to-night. I have been occupying a position, since the Presidential election, of silence, of avoiding public speaking, of avoiding public writing. I have been doing so because I thought, upon full consideration, that was the proper course for me to take. (Great applause.) I am brought before you now and required to make a speech, when you all approve, more than anything else, of the fact that I have been silent---(loud laughter, cries of ``Good---good,'' and applause)---and now it seems to me from the response you give to that remark it ought to justify me in closing just here. (Great laughter.) I have not kept silent since the Presidential election from any party wantonness, or from any indifference to the anxiety that pervades the minds of men about the aspect of the political affairs of this country. I have kept silence<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;231</span>
for the reason that I supposed it was peculiarly proper that I should do so until the time came when, according to the customs of the country, I should speak officially. (Voice, partially interrogative, partially sarcastic, ``Custom of the country?'') I heard some gentleman say, ``According to the custom of the country;'' I alluded to the custom of the President elect at the time of taking his oath of office. That is what I meant by the custom of the country. I do suppose that while the political drama being enacted in this country at this time is rapidly shifting in its scenes, forbidding an anticipation with any degree of certainty to-day what we shall see to-morrow, that it was peculiarly fitting that I should see it all up to the last minute before I should take ground, that I might be disposed by the shifting of the scenes afterwards again to shift. (Applause.) I said several times upon this journey, and I now repeat it to you, that when the time does come I shall then take the ground that I think is right---(interruption by cries of ``Good,'' ``good,'' and applause)---the ground I think is right for the North, for the South, for the East, for the West, for the whole country---(cries of ``Good,'' ``Hurrah for Lincoln,'' and great applause). And in doing so I hope to feel no necessity pressing upon me to say anything in conflict with the constitution, in conflict with the continued union of these States---(applause)---in conflict with the perpetuation of the liberties of these people---(cheers)---or anything in conflict with anything whatever that I have ever given you reason to expect from me. (Loud cheers.) And now, my friends, have I said enough. (Cries of ``No, no,'' ``Go on,'' &amp;c.) Now, my friends, there appears to be a difference of opinion between you and me, and I feel called upon to insist upon deciding the question myself. (Enthusiastic cheers.)</p>

<p>Mr. MAYOR---It is with feelings of deep gratitude that I make my acknowledgment for this reception which has been given me in the great commercial city of New York. I cannot but remember that this is done by a people who do not by a majority agree with me in political sentiments. It is the more grateful [to me] because in this reception I see that, in regard to the great principles of our government, the people are very nearly or quite unanimous.</p>
<p>In reference to the difficulties that confront us at this time, and of which your Honor thought fit to speak so becomingly and so justly as I suppose, I can only say that I fully concur in the sentiments expressed by the Mayor. In my devotion to the Union I hope I am behind no man in the Union; but as to the wisdom with which to conduct affairs tending to the preservation of the Union, I fear<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;233</span>
that even too great confidence may have been reposed [placed] in me. I am sure I bring a heart devoted to the work.</p>
<p>There is nothing that can ever bring me willingly to consent to the destruction of this Union, under which not only the commercial city of New York, but the whole country has acquired its greatness, unless it were to be that thing for which the Union itself was made. I understand a ship to be made for the carrying and preservation of the cargo, and so long as the ship can be saved, with the cargo, it should never be abandoned. This Union should likewise never be abandoned unless it fails and the probability of its preservation shall cease to exist without throwing the passengers and cargo overboard. So long, then, as it is possible that the prosperity and the liberties of the people can be preserved in the Union, it shall be my purpose at all times to preserve it. Thanking you for the reception given me, allow me to come to a close.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen of the State of New-Jersey, I shall only thank you briefly for this very kind and cordial reception---not as given to me individually, but as to the representative of the chief magistracy of this great nation. I cannot make any speech now to<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;234</span>
you, as I shall be met frequently to-day in the same manner as you have received me here, and, therefore, have not the strength to address you at length. I am here before you care-worn, for little else than to greet you, and to say farewell. You have done me the very high honor to present your reception of me through your own great man---a man with whom it is an honor to be associated anywhere---a man with whom no State could be poor. [Applause, long continued.] His remarks of welcome, though brief, deserve an hour's well-considered reply; but time, and the obligations before me, render it necessary for me to close my remarks---allow me to bid you a kind and grateful farewell.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln's remarks were received with demonstrations of applause, and the waving of handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>Loud calls were then made for Vice-President Hamlin; but it was announced that he was not present, and would be detained in New-York till to-morrow.</p>
<p>Then followed a rush to shake hands with Mr. Lincoln, and in the rush and crush the policemen and reporters were nearly annihilated. Loud cries were kept up for ``Lincoln, Lincoln,'' and to quiet the crowd Mr. Lincoln once more came to the front of the platform and said:</p>
<p>There appears to be a desire to see more of me, and I can only say that from my position, especially when I look around the gallery (bowing to the ladies), I feel that I have decidedly the best of the bargain, and in this matter I am for no compromises here. [Applause and much laughter.]</p>

<p>MR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE OF THE STATE OF NEW-JERSEY: I am very grateful to you for the honorable reception of which I have been the object. I cannot but remember the place that New-Jersey holds in our early history. In the early Revolutionary struggle, few of the States among the old Thirteen had more of the battle-fields of the country within their limits than old New-Jersey. May I be pardoned if, upon this occasion, I mention that away back in my childhood, the earliest days of my being able to read, I got hold of a small book, such a one as few of the younger members have ever seen, ``Weem's Life of Washington.'' I remember all the accounts there given of the battle fields and struggles for the liberties of the country, and none fixed themselves upon my imagination so deeply as the struggle here at Trenton, New-Jersey. The crossing of the river; the contest with the Hessians; the great hardships endured at that time, all fixed themselves on my memory more than any single revolutionary event; and you all know, for you have all been boys, how these early impressions<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;236</span>
last longer than any others. I recollect thinking then, boy even though I was, that there must have been something more than common that those men struggled for. I am exceedingly anxious that that thing which they struggled for; that something even more than National Independence; that something that held out a great promise to all the people of the world to all time to come; I am exceedingly anxious that this Union, the Constitution, and the liberties of the people shall be perpetuated in accordance with the original idea for which that struggle was made, and I shall be most happy indeed if I shall be an humble instrument in the hands of the Almighty, and of this, his almost chosen people, for perpetuating the object of that great struggle. You give me this reception, as I understand, without distinction of party. I learn that this body is composed of a majority of gentlemen who, in the exercise of their best judgment in the choice of a Chief Magistrate, did not think I was the man. I understand, nevertheless, that they came forward here to greet me as the constitutional President of the United States---as citizens of the United States, to meet the man who, for the time being, is the representative man of the nation, united by a purpose to perpetuate the Union and liberties of the people. As such, I accept this reception more gratefully than I could do did I believe it was tendered to me as an individual.</p>

<p>MR. SPEAKER AND GENTLEMEN: I have just enjoyed the honor of a reception by the other branch of this Legislature, and I return to you and them my thanks for the reception which the people of New-Jersey have given, through their chosen representatives, to me, as the representative, for the time being, of the majesty of the people of the United States. I appropriate to myself very little of the demonstrations of respect with which I have been greeted. I think little should be given to any man, but that it should be a manifestation of adherence to the Union and the Constitution. I understand myself to be received here by the representatives of the people of New-Jersey, a majority of whom differ in opinion from those with whom I have acted. This manifestation is therefore to be regarded by me as expressing their devotion to the</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;237</span>Union, the Constitution and the liberties of the people. You, Mr. Speaker, have well said that this is a time when the bravest and wisest look with doubt and awe upon the aspect presented by our national affairs. Under these circumstances, you will readily see why I should not speak in detail of the course I shall deem it best to pursue. It is proper that I should avail myself of all the information and all the time at my command, in order that when the time arrives in which I must speak officially, I shall be able to take the ground which I deem the best and safest, and from which I may have no occasion to swerve. I shall endeavor to take the ground I deem most just to the North, the East, the West, the South, and the whole country. I take it, I hope, in good temper---certainly no malice toward any section. I shall do all that may be in my power to promote a peaceful settlement of all our difficulties. The man does not live who is more devoted to peace than I am. [Cheers.] None who would do more to preserve it. But it may be necessary to put the foot down firmly. [Here the audience broke out into cheers so loud and long that for some moments it was impossible to hear Mr. L.'s voice.] He continued: And if I do my duty, and do right, you will sustain me, will you not? [Loud cheers, and cries of ``Yes,'' ``Yes,'' ``We will.''] Received, as I am, by the members of a Legislature the majority of whom do not agree with me in political sentiments, I trust that I may have their assistance in piloting the ship of State through this voyage, surrounded by perils as it is; for, if it should suffer attack now, there will be no pilot ever needed for another voyage.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I have already spoken longer than I intended, and must beg leave to stop here.</p>

<p>Mr. Mayor and Fellow Citizens of Philadelphia---I appear before you to make no lengthy speech. I appear before you to thank you for the reception. The reception you have given me to-night is not to me, the man, the individual, but to the man who temporarily represents, or should represent, the majesty of the nation. (Applause.) It is true, as your worthy Mayor has said, that there is great anxiety amongst the citizens of the United States at this time. I say I deem it a happy circumstance that the dissatisfied portion of our fellow citizens do not point us to anything in which they are being injured, or about to be injured, from which I have felt all the while justified in concluding that the crisis, the panic, the anxiety of the country at this time is artificial. If there be those who differ with me upon this subject, they have not pointed out the substantial difficulty that exists. (Tremendous cheering.)</p>
<p>I do not mean to say that this artificial panic has not done harm. That it has done much harm I do not deny. The hope that has been expressed by your worthy Mayor, that I may be able to restore peace and harmony and prosperity to the country, is most worthy in him; and most happy indeed shall I be if I shall be able to fulfill and verify that hope. (Cheers.)</p>
<p>I promise you in all sincerity, that I bring to the work a sincere heart. Whether I will bring a head equal to that heart, will be for future time to determine. It were useless for me to speak of the details of the plans now. I shall speak officially on next Monday week, if ever. If I should not speak, then it were useless for me to do so now. [If I do speak, then it is useless for me to do so now.]<span class="ptr"><a name="4_238_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_238_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> When I do speak, as your worthy Mayor has expressed the hope, I will take such grounds as I shall deem best calculated to restore peace, harmony and prosperity to the country, and tend to the perpetuity of the nation, and the liberty of these States and all these people. (Applause.)</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;239</span>Your worthy Mayor has expressed the wish, in which I join with him, that if it were convenient for me to remain with you in your city long enough to consult, [your merchants and manufacturers;]<span class="ptr"><a name="4_239_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_239_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> or, as it were, to listen to those breathings rising within the consecrated walls where the Constitution of the United States, and, I will add, the Declaration of American Independence was originally framed, I would do so.</p>
<p>I assure you and your Mayor that I had hoped on this occasion, and upon all occasions during my life, that I shall do nothing inconsistent with the teachings of those holy and most sacred walls.</p>
<p>I have never asked anything that does not breathe from those walls. All my political warfare has been in favor of the teachings coming forth from that sacred hall. May my right hand forget its cunning and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if ever I prove false to those teachings.</p>
<p>Fellow citizens, I have addressed you longer than I expected to do, and allow me now to bid you good night.</p>

<p>Mr. CUYLER:---I am filled with deep emotion at finding myself standing here in the place where were collected together the wisdom, the patriotism, the devotion to principle, from which sprang the institutions under which we live. You have kindly suggested to me that in my hands is the task of restoring peace to our distracted country. I can say in return, sir, that all the political sentiments I entertain have been drawn, so far as I have been able to draw them, from the sentiments which originated, and were given to the world from this hall in which we stand. I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence. (Great cheering.) I have often pondered over the dangers which were incurred by the men who assembled here and adopted<span class="ptr"><a name="4_240_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_240_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> that Declaration of Independence---I have pondered over the toils that were endured by the officers and soldiers of the army, who achieved that Independence. (Applause.) I have often inquired of myself, what great principle or idea it was that kept this Confederacy so long together. It was not the mere matter of the separation of the colonies from the mother land; but something in that Declaration giving liberty,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_240_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_240_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> not alone to the people of this country, but hope to the world for all future time. (Great applause.) It was that which gave promise that in due time the weights should be lifted from the shoulders of all men, and that <span class="rend-i">all</span> should have an equal chance. (Cheers.) This is the sentiment embodied in that Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>Now, my friends, can this country be saved upon that basis? If it can, I will consider myself one of the happiest men in the world if I can help to save it. If it can't be saved upon that principle, it will be truly awful. But, if this country cannot be saved without giving up that principle---I was about to say I would rather be assassinated on this spot than to surrender it.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_240_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_240_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[4]</a></span> (Applause.)</p>
<p>Now, in my view of the present aspect of affairs, there is no need of bloodshed and war. There is no necessity for it. I am not<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;241</span>
in favor of such a course, and I may say in advance, there will be no blood shed unless it be forced upon the Government. The Government will not use force unless force is used against it.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_241_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_241_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[5]</a></span> (Prolonged applause and cries of ``That's the proper sentiment.'')</p>
<p>My friends, this is a wholly unprepared speech. I did not expect to be called upon to say a word when I came here---I supposed I was merely to do something towards raising a flag. I may, therefore, have said something indiscreet, (cries of ``no, no''), but I have said nothing but what I am willing to live by, and, in<span class="ptr"><a name="4_241_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_241_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[6]</a></span> the pleasure of Almighty God, die by.</p>

<p>FELLOW CITIZENS:---I am invited and called before you to participate in raising above Independence Hall the flag of our country, with an additional star upon it. (Cheers.) I propose now, in advance of performing this very pleasant and complimentary duty, to say a few words. I propose to say that when that flag was originally raised here it had but thirteen stars. I wish to call your attention to the fact, that, under the blessing of God, each additional star added to that flag has given additional prosperity and happiness to this country until it has advanced to its present condition; and its welfare in the future, as well as in the past, is in your hands. (Cheers.) Cultivating the spirit that animated our fathers, who gave renown and celebrity to this Hall, cherishing that fraternal feeling which has so long characterized us as a nation, excluding passion, ill-temper and precipitate action on all occasions, I think we may promise ourselves that not only the new star placed upon that flag shall be permitted to remain there to our permanent prosperity for years to come, but additional ones shall from time to time be placed there, until we shall number as was anticipated by<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;242</span>
the great historian, five hundred millions of happy and prosperous people. (Great applause.) With these few remarks, I proceed to the very agreeable duty assigned me.</p>

<p>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF OLD LANCASTER: I appear not to make a speech. I have not time to make them at length, and not strength to make them on every occasion, and, worse than all, I have none to make. I come before you to see and be seen and, as regards the ladies, I have the best of the bargain; but, as to the gentlemen, I cannot say as much. There is plenty of matter to speak about in these times, but it is well known that the more a man speaks the less he is understood---the more he says one thing, his adversaries contend he meant something else. I shall soon have occasion to speak officially, and then I will endeavor to put my thoughts just as plain as I can express myself, true to the Constitution and Union of all the States, and to the perpetual liberty of all the people. Until I so speak, there is no need to enter upon<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;243</span>
details. In conclusion, I greet you most heartily, and bid you an affectionate farewell.</p>

<p>Gov. Curtin and citizens of the State of Pennsylvania: Perhaps the best thing that I could do would be simply to endorse the patriotic and eloquent speech which your Governor has just made in your hearing. [Applause.] I am quite sure that I am unable to address to you anything so appropriate as that which he has uttered.</p>
<p>Reference has been made by him to the distraction of the public mind at this time and to the great task that lies before me in entering upon the administration of the General Government. With all the eloquence and ability that your Governor brings to this theme, I am quite sure he does not---in his situation he cannot---appreciate as I do the weight of that great responsibility. I feel that, under God, in the strength of the arms and wisdom of the heads of these masses, after all, must be my support. [Immense cheering.] As I have often had occasion to say, I repeat to you---I am quite sure I do not deceive myself when I tell you I bring to the work an honest heart; I dare not tell you that I bring a head sufficient for it. [A voice---``we are sure of that.''] If my own strength should fail, I shall at least fall back upon these masses, who, I think, under any circumstances will not fail.</p>
<p>Allusion has been made to the peaceful principles upon which this great Commonwealth was originally settled. Allow me to add my meed of praise to those peaceful principles. I hope no one of the Friends who originally settled here, or who lived here since that time, or who live here now, has been or is a more devoted lover of peace, harmony and concord than my humble self.</p>
<p>While I have been proud to see to-day the finest military array, I think, that I have ever seen, allow me to say in regard to those men that they give hope of what may be done when war is inevitable. But, at the same time, allow me to express the hope that in the shedding of blood their services may never be needed, especially in the shedding of fraternal blood. It shall be my endeavor to preserve the peace of this country so far as it can possibly be done, consistently with the maintenance of the institutions of the<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;244</span>
country. With my consent, or without my great displeasure, this country shall never witness the shedding of one drop of blood in fraternal strife.</p>
<p>And now, my fellow-citizens, as I have made many speeches, will you allow me to bid you farewell?</p>

<div class="opener">February 22, 1861</div>
<p><span class="rend-i">Mr. Speaker of the Senate and also Mr. Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Gentlemen of the General Assembly of the State of Pennsylvania</span>, I appear before you only for a very few brief remarks in response to what has been said to me. I thank you most sincerely for this reception, and the generous words in which support has been promised me upon this occasion. I thank your great Commonwealth for the overwhelming support it recently gave---not me personally---but the cause which I think a just one, in the late election. [Loud applause.]</p>
<p>Allusion has been made to the fact---the interesting fact perhaps we should say---that I for the first time appear at the Capitol of the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, upon the birthday of the Father of his Country. In connection with that beloved anniversary connected with the history of this country, I have already gone through one exceedingly interesting scene this morning in the ceremonies at Philadelphia. Under the kind conduct of gentlemen there, I was for the first time allowed the privilege of standing in old Independence Hall, [enthusiastic cheering], to have a few words addressed to me there and opening up to me an opportunity of expressing with much regret that I had not more time to express something of my own feelings excited by the occasion---somewhat to harmonize and give shape to the feelings that had been really the feelings of my whole life.</p>
<p>Besides this, our friends there had provided a magnificent flag of the country. They had arranged it so that I was given the honor of raising it to the head of its staff [applause]; and when it went up, I was pleased that it went to its place by the strength of my own feeble arm. When, according to the arrangement, the cord was pulled and it flaunted gloriously to the wind without an accident, in the light [bright]<span class="ptr"><a name="4_244_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_244_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> glowing sun-shine of the morning, I could<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;245</span>
not help hoping that there was in the entire success of that beautiful ceremony, at least something of an omen of what is to come. [Loud applause.] Nor could I help, feeling then as I often have felt, that in the whole of that proceeding I was a very humble instrument. I had not provided the flag; I had not made the arrangement for elevating it to its place; I had applied but a very small portion of even my feeble strength in raising it. In the whole transaction, I was in the hands of the people who had arranged it, and if I can have the same generous co-operation of the people of this nation, I think the flag of our country may yet be kept flaunting gloriously. [Enthusiastic, long continued cheering.]</p>
<p>I recur for a moment but to repeat some words uttered at the hotel in regard to what has been said about the military support which the general government may expect from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, in a proper emergency. To guard against any possible mistake do I recur to this. It is not with any pleasure that I contemplate the possibility that a necessity may arise in this country for the use of the military arm. [Applause.] While I am exceedingly gratified to see the manifestation upon your streets of your military force here, and exceedingly gratified at your promise here to use that force upon a proper emergency, while I make these acknowledgments, I desire to repeat, in order to preclude any possible misconstruction, that I do most sincerely hope that we shall have no use for them---[loud applause]---that it will never become their duty to shed blood, and most especially never to shed fraternal blood. I promise that, (in so far as I may have wisdom to direct,) if so painful a result shall in any wise be brought about, it shall be through no fault of mine. [Cheers.]</p>
<p>Allusion has also been made, by one of your honored Speakers, to some remarks recently made by myself at Pittsburg, in regard to what is supposed to be the especial interest of this great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I now wish only to say, in regard to that matter, that the few remarks which I uttered on that occasion were rather carefully worded. I took pains that they should be so. I have seen no occasion since to add to them or subtract from them. I leave them precisely as they stand; [applause] adding only now that I am pleased to have an expression from you, gentlemen of Pennsylvania, significant that they are satisfactory to you.</p>
<p>And now, gentlemen of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, allow me again to return to you my most sincere thanks.</p>
<p>[Mr. Lincoln took his seat amid rapturous and prolonged cheering.]</p>

<p>Mr. MAYOR---I thank you, and through you the municipal authorities of this city by whom you are accompanied for this welcome; and as it is the first time in my life, since the present phase of politics has presented itself in this country, that I have said anything publicly within a region of country where the institution of slavery exists, I will take this occasion to say, that I think very much of the ill feeling that has existed and still exists between the people of the section from whence I came and the people here, is owing to a misunderstanding between each other which unhappily prevails. I therefore avail myself of this opportunity to assure you, Mr. Mayor, and all the gentlemen present, that I have not now, and never have had, any other than as kindly feelings towards you as to the people of my own section. I have not now, and never have had, any disposition to treat you in any respect otherwise than as my own neighbors. I have not now any purpose to withhold from you any of the benefits of the constitution, under any circumstances, that I would not feel myself constrained to withhold from my own neighbors; and I hope, in a word, when we shall become<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;247</span>

<p>MY FRIENDS---I suppose that I may take this as a compliment paid to me, and as such please accept my thanks for it. I have reached this city of Washington under circumstances considerably differing from those under which any other man has ever reached it. I have reached it for the purpose of taking an official position amongst the people, almost all of whom were opposed to me, and are yet opposed to me, as I suppose. (Several voices, ``No, no.'' Other voices ``Go on, sir; you are mistaken in that, indeed you are.'') I propose no lengthy address to you now. I only propose to say, as I did say on yesterday, I believe, when your worthy Mayor and Board of Aldermen called upon me, that I thought much of the ill feeling that has existed between you and the people of your surroundings and that people from amongst whom I come, has depended, and now depends, upon a misunderstanding. (Several voices---``That's so;'' and applause.) I hope that if things shall go along as prosperously as I believe we all desire they may, I may have it in my power to remove something of this misunderstanding---(cries of ``Good,'' ``Good,'' and loud applause)---that I may be enabled to convince you, and the people of your section of the country, that we regard you as in all things being our equals---in all things entitled to the same respect and to the same treatment that we claim for ourselves---(cries of ``Good,'' and applause)---that we are in no wise disposed, if it were in our power, to oppress you or deprive you of any of your rights under the constitution of the United States or even narrowly to split hairs with you in regard to these rights. (Loud and prolonged cheering.) But are determined to give you, so far as lies in our hands, all your rights under the constitution, not grudgingly, but fully and fairly. (Cries of ``Good,'' and applause.) I hope that by thus dealing with you we will become better acquainted and be better friends. (Cries of ``Good,'' and applause.) And now my friends with these very few remarks, I again return my thanks for this compliment, and expressing my desire to hear a little more of your good music, I bid you good night.</p>

By no other course could I meet the reasonable expectations of the country.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_250_8"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_250_8;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[11]</a></span></p>
<p>I do not consider it necessary at present for me to<span class="ptr"><a name="4_250_9"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_250_9;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[12]</a></span> say more than I have, in relation to those matters of administration, about which there is no special excitement.</p>
<p>Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States, that by the accession of a Republican Administration, their property, and their peace, and personal security, are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed, and been open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that ``I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.'' Those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that I had made this and many other similar declarations, and had never recanted them. And more than this, they placed in the platform, for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves, and to me, the clear and emphatic resolution which I now read:</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;251</span>``<span class="rend-i">Resolved</span>, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the States, and especially the right of each State to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend; and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any State or Territory, no matter under what pretext, as among the gravest of crimes.''</p>
<p>I now reiterate these sentiments: and in doing so, I only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible, that the property, peace and security of no section are to be in anywise endangered by the now incoming Administration. I add too, that all the protection which, consistently with the Constitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given<span class="ptr"><a name="4_251_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_251_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[13]</a></span> to all the States---as cheerfully to one section as to another.</p>
<p>There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labor. The clause I now read is as plainly written in the Constitution as any other of its provisions:</p>
<p>``No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.''</p>
<p>It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it, for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and the intention of the law-giver is the law. All members of Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution---to this provision as much as to any other. To the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause, ``shall be delivered up,'' their oaths are unanimous. Now, if they would all begin<span class="ptr"><a name="4_251_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_251_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[14]</a></span> in good temper, could they not, with something like<span class="ptr"><a name="4_251_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_251_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[15]</a></span> nearly equal unanimity, frame and pass a law,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_251_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_251_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[16]</a></span> through which to keep good that unanimous oath?</p>
<p>There is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by state authority; but surely that difference is not a very material one. If the slave is to be surrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him, or to others, by which authority it is done. And should any one, in any case, be content<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;252</span>
that his oath shall go unkept, on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to <span class="rend-i">how</span> it shall be kept?</p>
<p>Again, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in human and<span class="ptr"><a name="4_252_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_252_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[17]</a></span> civilized jurisprudence to be introduced, so that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave?</p>
<p>I take the official oath to-day, with no mental reservations, and with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws, by any hypercritical rules. And while I do not think proper<span class="ptr"><a name="4_252_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_252_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[18]</a></span> now to specify particular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest that it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations, to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed, than to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional.</p>
<p>It is now<span class="ptr"><a name="4_252_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_252_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[19]</a></span> seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President under our national Constitution. During the<span class="ptr"><a name="4_252_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_252_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[20]</a></span> period between then and now,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_252_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_252_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[21]</a></span> fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens, have in succession, administered the executive branch of the government. They have conducted it through many perils; and, on the whole,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_252_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_252_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[22]</a></span> with great success. Yet, with all this scope for precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four years, under great and peculiar difficulty. A disruption of the Federal Union<span class="ptr"><a name="4_252_7"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_252_7;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[23]</a></span> is menaced, and, so far as can be on paper, is already effected. The particulars of what has been done are so familiar and so fresh, that I need<span class="ptr"><a name="4_252_8"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_252_8;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[24]</a></span> to waste no<span class="ptr"><a name="4_252_9"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_252_9;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[25]</a></span> time in recounting them.</p>
<p>I hold, that in contemplation of universal law, and of the Constitution, the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments. It is safe to assert that no government proper, ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination. Continue to execute all the express provisions of our national Constitution, and the Union will endure forever---it being impossible to destroy it, except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;253</span>Again, if the United States be not a government proper, but an association of States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a contract, be peaceably unmade, by less than all the parties who made it? One party to a contract may violate it---break it, so to speak; but does it not require all to<span class="ptr"><a name="4_253_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_253_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[26]</a></span> rescind it?</p>
<p>Descending from these general principles, we find the proposition that, in legal contemplation, the Union is perpetual, confirmed by the history of the Union itself. The Union is much older than the Constitution. It was formed in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774. It was matured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776. It was further matured and expressly declared and pledged,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_253_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_253_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[27]</a></span> to be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation in 1778. And finally, in 1787, one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the Constitution, was ``<span class="rend-i">to form a more perfect union.''</span></p>
<p>But if destruction of the Union, by one, or by a part only, of the States, be lawfully possible, the Union is <span class="rend-i">less</span> perfect than before, which<span class="ptr"><a name="4_253_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_253_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[28]</a></span> contradicts the Constitution, and therefore is absurd.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_253_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_253_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[29]</a></span></p>
<p>It follows from these views that no State, upon its own mere motion, can lawfully get out of the Union,---that <span class="rend-i">resolves</span> and <span class="rend-i">ordinances</span> to that effect are legally nothing;<span class="ptr"><a name="4_253_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_253_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[30]</a></span> and that acts of violence, within any State or States,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_253_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_253_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[31]</a></span> are insurrectionary or treasonable,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_253_7"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_253_7;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[32]</a></span> according to circumstances.</p>
<p>I therefore consider that<span class="ptr"><a name="4_253_8"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_253_8;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[33]</a></span> the Union is unbroken; and, to the extent of my ability, I shall take care<span class="ptr"><a name="4_253_9"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_253_9;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[34]</a></span> that the laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States. Doing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part; and I shall perform it,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_253_10"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_253_10;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[35]</a></span> unless my rightful masters, the American people, shall withhold the requisite means, or, in some tangible way,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_253_11"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_253_11;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[36]</a></span> direct the contrary. I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the declared purpose<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;254</span>
of the Union that it will<span class="ptr"><a name="4_254_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_254_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[37]</a></span> have its own, and defend itself.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_254_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_254_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there shall be none, unless<span class="ptr"><a name="4_254_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_254_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[39]</a></span> forced upon the national authority.

<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;255</span>The mails, unless refused, will continue to be furnished in all parts of the Union. So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_255_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_255_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[46]</a></span></p>
<p>That there are persons<span class="ptr"><a name="4_255_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_255_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[47]</a></span> who seek to destroy the Union at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will neither affirm or deny; but if there be such, I need address no word to them.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_255_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_255_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[48]</a></span> To those, however, who really love the Union, may I not speak?</p>
<p>Before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national Union,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_255_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_255_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[49]</a></span> would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it? Will you hazard so desperate a step, while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence? Will you while the certain ills you fly to, are greater than all the real ones you fly from? Will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake?</p>
<p>All profess to be content in the Union, if all constitutional rights can be maintained. Is it true, then, that any<span class="ptr"><a name="4_255_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_255_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[50]</a></span> right, plainly written in the Constitution, has been denied? I think not. Happily the human mind is so constructed, that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this. Think, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the Constitution has ever been denied. If, by the mere force of numbers, a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right, it might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution---certainly would, if such right were a vital one;<span class="ptr"><a name="4_255_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_255_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[51]</a></span>---but such is not our case. All the vital rights of minorities, and of individuals, are so plainly assured to them, by affirmations and negations<span class="ptr"><a name="4_255_7"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_255_7;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[52]</a></span> in the Constitution, that controversies never arise concerning them. But no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every<span class="ptr"><a name="4_255_8"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_255_8;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[53]</a></span> question which may occur in practical administration.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;256</span>No foresight can anticipate, nor any document of reasonable length contain express provisions for all possible questions. Shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or by State authority? The Constitution does not expressly say. <span class="rend-i">May</span> Congress prohibit slavery in the territories? The Constitution does not expressly say. <span class="rend-i">Must</span> Congress protect slavery in the territories? The Constitution does not expressly say.</p>
<p>From questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies, and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities. If the minority will not submit,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_256_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_256_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[54]</a></span> the majority must, or the government must cease. There is no other alternative; for continuing the government, is submission<span class="ptr"><a name="4_256_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_256_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[55]</a></span> on one side or the other. If a minority, in such case, will secede rather than submit,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_256_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_256_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[56]</a></span> they make a precedent which, in turn, will divide and ruin them; for a minority of their own number<span class="ptr"><a name="4_256_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_256_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[57]</a></span> will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_256_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_256_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[58]</a></span> For instance, why may not South Carolina,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_256_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_256_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[59]</a></span> a year or two hence, arbitrarily, secede from<span class="ptr"><a name="4_256_7"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_256_7;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[60]</a></span> a new Southern Confederacy, just as she<span class="ptr"><a name="4_256_8"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_256_8;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[61]</a></span> now claims to secede from the present Union?

people. Whoever rejects it, does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity is impossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement, is wholly inadmissable; so that, rejecting the majority principle, anarchy or despotism<span class="ptr"><a name="4_257_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_257_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[66]</a></span> is all that is left.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_257_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_257_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[67]</a></span></p>
<p>Some, if not all of the States which claim to have withdrawn from the Union, have declared the supposed grievances which impelled them to the separation. Most prominent among these is the charge, in substance, that the Republican party have <span class="rend-i">avowed</span> the purpose to destroy the property of the Southern people. With all due deference and respect, allow me to declare that the Republican party have made no such avowal. The Republican party of the nation have spoken but twice; and in both instances they expressly avowed what necessarily implies the exact contrary---in 1860, as<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;258</span>
already quoted in this discourse; and, in 1856, in their National Convention at Philadelphia, as I now read:</p>
<p>``<span class="rend-i">Resolved</span>, That the maintenance of the principles promulgated in the Declaration of Independence, and embodied in the Federal Constitution, is essential to the preservation of Republican institutions, and that the Federal Constitution, <span class="rend-i">the rights of the States</span>, and the Union of the States, shall be preserved.''</p>
<p>In addition to this, I aver that, to my knowledge, no sub-division, or individual, of the Republican party has ever avowed, or entertained, a purpose to destroy or to interfere with the property of the Southern people. For myself, I can declare, with perfect certainty, that I have never avowed, or entertained any such purpose; and I have never used any expression intended to convey such a meaning.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_258_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_258_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[68]</a></span></p>
<p>The<span class="ptr"><a name="4_258_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_258_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[69]</a></span> Republican party, as I understand, have avowed the purpose to prevent, if they can, the extension of slavery, under the national auspices; and upon this arises the only<span class="ptr"><a name="4_258_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_258_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[70]</a></span> dispute between the sections.</p>
<p>One section<span class="ptr"><a name="4_258_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_258_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[71]</a></span> believes slavery is <span class="rend-i">right</span>, and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is <span class="rend-i">wrong</span>, and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive slave clause of the Constitution, and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade, are each as well enforced,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_258_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_258_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[72]</a></span> as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people is against<span class="ptr"><a name="4_258_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_258_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[73]</a></span> the law itself. The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each. This, I think, cannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases <span class="rend-i">after</span> the separation of the sections, than before. The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be<span class="ptr"><a name="4_258_7"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_258_7;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[74]</a></span> revived without<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;259</span>
restriction, in one section; while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all, by the other.</p>
<p>Physically speaking, we cannot separate. We cannot remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them. A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out of the presence, and beyond the reach of each other; but the different parts of our country cannot do this. They cannot but remain face to face; and intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them. Is it possible<span class="ptr"><a name="4_259_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_259_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[75]</a></span> to make that intercourse more advantageous or<span class="ptr"><a name="4_259_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_259_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[76]</a></span> satisfactory, <span class="rend-i">after</span> separation than <span class="rend-i">before</span>? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides, and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions, as to terms of intercourse, are again upon you.</p>
<p>During<span class="ptr"><a name="4_259_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_259_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[77]</a></span> the winter just closed, I have been greatly urged, by many patriotic men, to lend the influence of my position to some compromise, by which I was, to some extent, to shift the ground upon which I had been elected. This I steadily refused. I so refused, not from any party wantonness, nor from any indifference to the troubles of the country. I thought such refusal was demanded by the view that if, when a Chief Magistrate is constitutionally elected, he cannot be inaugurated till he betrays those who elected him, by breaking his pledges, and surrendering to those who tried and failed to defeat him at the polls, this government and all popular government is already at an end. Demands for such surrender, once recognized, are without limit, as to nature, extent and repetition. They break the only bond of faith between public and public servant; and they distinctly set the minority over the majority.</p>
<p>I presume there is not a man in America, (and there ought not to be one) who opposed my election, who would, for a moment, tolerate his own candidate in such surrender, had he been successful in the election. In such case they would all see, that such surrender would not be merely the ruin of a man, or a party; but, as a precedent, would be the ruin of the government itself.</p>
<p>I do not deny the possibility that the people may err in an election; but if they do, the true cure is in the next election; and not in the treachery of the party elected.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;260</span>Why<span class="ptr"><a name="4_260_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_260_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[78]</a></span> should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people?

<p>By the frame of the government under which we live, this same people have widely given their public servants but little power for mischief; and have, with equal wisdom, provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very short intervals.</p>
<p>While<span class="ptr"><a name="4_260_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_260_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[82]</a></span> the people remain patient, and true to themselves, no man, even in the presidential chair, by any extreme of wickedness or folly, can<span class="ptr"><a name="4_260_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_260_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[83]</a></span> very seriously injure the government in the short space of four years.</p>

Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise their <span class="rend-i">constitutional</span> right of amending it, or their <span class="rend-i">revolutionary</span> right to dismember or overthrow it. As<span class="ptr"><a name="4_260_8"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_260_8;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[85]</a></span> I am not much impressed with the belief that the present Constitution can be improved, I make no recommendations of amendments.

<p>The Chief Magistrate derives all his authority from the people, and they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;261</span>
of the States. The people themselves can do this<span class="ptr"><a name="4_261_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_261_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[88]</a></span> if they choose; but the executive, as such, has nothing to do with it. His duty is to administer the present government, as it came to his hands, and to transmit it,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_261_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_261_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[89]</a></span> unimpaired by him, to his successor.</p>

Such of you as are now dissatisfied, still have the old Constitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point, the laws of your own framing under it; while the new administration will have no immediate power, if it would, to change either. If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied, hold the right side in the dispute, there still is no single good reason for precipitate action. Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance on Him, who has never yet forsaken this favored land, are still competent to adjust, in the best way, all our present difficulty.</p>

<h3>Annotation</h3>
<a name="4_249_1"></a><div class="textindentlevelx" id="4_249_1">
<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; Documents, DLC-RTL. The original manuscript was composed during January, 1861, but, with the exception noted below (note 2) is presumably not extant. It was set in type at the office of the <span class="rend-i">Illinois State Journal</span> and printed in eight numbered pages. How many copies were struck off is not known, but there are two extant copies in the Lincoln Papers, both labeled ``First Edition'' by Lincoln. One of these copies, which bears no corrections, is herein reproduced. The revisions in Lincoln's hand on the second copy, as well as subsequent revisions, by Lincoln, Seward, and Browning, are indicated by means of footnotes. For the final text, see First Inaugural Address---Final Text, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>.</p>
<p>Lincoln must have made further revisions in proof sheets of the First Edition before the printing of the Second Edition, for the Second Edition omits some paragraphs and shows verbal changes from his corrected First Edition. No source of these corrections has been found.</p>
<p>There are five extant copies of the Second Edition: one copy (in the Lincoln Papers) bears further corrections in Lincoln's handwriting, some of which, at least, were adopted after Lincoln had studied Seward's suggestions for revision in late February; a second copy (in the Henry E. Huntington Library) which was given to Orville H. Browning bears his single suggestion for revision; a third copy (in the Lincoln Papers) with lines numbered by Seward is accompanied by six pages (including a verso) of Seward's manuscript suggestions for revision keyed to the line numbering (footnotes herein show Seward's suggestions relegated to their appropriate places in text); a fourth copy (in the Lincoln Papers) bears Nicolay's transcription of Seward's suggestions; and a fifth copy was cut up into clippings which were used in the preparation of the final text (<span class="rend-i">infra</span>).</p>
<p>In addition to the clippings from the fifth copy of the second edition, the final text (<span class="rend-i">infra</span>) includes passages inserted in Lincoln's handwriting, incorporating but not closely following the preceding revisions and suggestions; many passages were completely rewritten. Two other copies of this final text were made up. One (in the Harvard Library) with Lincoln's rewritten portions copied in Nicolay's hand, was prepared by Nicolay for the press; the other (owned by Crosby N. Boyd of Washington, D.C.) was prepared by an unidentified hand specifically for the Washington <span class="rend-i">Star</span> as the earliest paper to go to press after the inaugural ceremonies.</p>
<p>Footnotes 3-99 indicate the revisions which were made or suggested up to the draft of the final text. Sources of revisions are indicated as follows: (L-1ST) indicates Lincoln's revision of the First Edition, and (L-2ND) his revision of the second edition; (S-2ND) indicates Seward's suggestions for revision of the second edition; and (B-2ND) indicates Browning's one suggestion.</p>

<p>[41]&nbsp;&nbsp; (B-2ND) Orville H. Browning suggested revision of this sentence to omit ``to reclaim the public property and places which have fallen'' and to continue `` . . . to hold, occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the government. . . . '' (L-2ND) Deletion adopted.</p>
<p>Browning to Lincoln February 17, 1861, explained that ``On principle the passage is right as it now stands. The fallen places ought to be reclaimed. But cannot that be accomplished as well, or even better without announcing the purpose in your inaugural?'' (DLC-RTL). On the back of Browning's letter Lincoln wrote the following sentence, probably as a tentative insertion to be made in the Address: ``Americans, all, we are not enemies, but friends. We have sacred ties of affection which, though strained by passion, let us hope can never be broken.'' (DLC-RTL). Part of this phrasing went into Lincoln's concluding paragraph added to the final copy following Seward's suggestion.

<p>``However unusual it may be at such a time to speak of sections or to sections, yet in view of the misconception &amp; agitations which have strained the ties of brotherhood so far, I hope it will not be deemed a departure from propriety, whatever it may be from custom, to say that if in the criminations and misconstructions which too often imbue our political contests, any man south of this capital has been led to believe that I regard with a less friendly eye, his rights, his interests or his domestic safety and happiness, or those of his State, than I do those of any other portion of my country or that I would invade or disturb any legal right or domestic institution in the South, he mistakes both my principles and feelings, and does not know me. I aspire to come in the spirit, however far below the ability and the wisdom, of Washington, of Madison, of Jackson and of Clay. In that spirit I here declare that in my administration I shall know no rule but the Constitution, no guide but the laws, and no sentiment but that of equal devotion to my whole country, east, west, north and south.''</p>

<p>Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States, that by the accession of a Republican Administration, their property, and their peace, and personal security, are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed, and been open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;263</span>I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that ``I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.'' Those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that I had made this, and many similar declarations, and had never recanted them. And more than this, they placed in the platform, for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves, and to me, the clear and emphatic resolution which I now read:</p>
<p>``<span class="rend-i">Resolved</span>, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the States, and especially the right of each State to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend; and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any State or Territory, no matter under what pretext, as among the gravest of crimes.''</p>
<p>I now reiterate these sentiments: and in doing so, I only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible, that the property, peace and security of no section are to be in anywise endangered by the now incoming Administration. I add too, that all the protection which, consistently with the Constitution and the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given to all the States<span class="ptr"><a name="4_263_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_263_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[4]</a></span> when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause---as cheerfully to one section,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_263_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_263_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[5]</a></span> as to another.</p>
<p>There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labor. The clause I now read is as plainly written in the Constitution as any other of its provisions:</p>
<p>``No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.''</p>
<p>It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it, for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and the intention of the law-giver is the law. All members of Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution---to this provision as much as to any other. To the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause, ``shall be delivered up,'' their oaths are unanimous. Now, if they would make the effort in good temper, could they not, with nearly equal<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;264</span>
unanimity, frame and pass a law, by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath?</p>
<p>There is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by state authority; but surely that difference is not a very material one. If the slave is to be surrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him, or to others, by which authority it is done. And should any one, in any case, be content that his oath shall go unkept, on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to <span class="rend-i">how</span> it shall be kept?</p>
<p>Again, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced, so that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave? And<span class="ptr"><a name="4_264_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_264_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[6]</a></span> might it not be well, at the same time, to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarranties that ``The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all previleges and immunities of citizens in the several States?''</p>
<p>I take the official oath to-day, with no mental reservations, and with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws, by any hypercritical rules. And while I do not choose<span class="ptr"><a name="4_264_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_264_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[7]</a></span> now to specify particular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_264_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_264_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[8]</a></span> that it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations, to conform to, and abide by, all those acts which stand unrepealed, than to violate any of them, trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional.</p>
<p>It is<span class="ptr"><a name="4_264_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_264_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[9]</a></span> seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President under our national Constitution. During that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens, have, in succession, administered the executive branch of the government. They have conducted it through many perils; and, generally,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_264_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_264_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[10]</a></span> with great success. Yet, with all this scope for precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four years, under great and peculiar difficulty. A disruption of the Federal Union<span class="ptr"><a name="4_264_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_264_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[11]</a></span> heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted.</p>
<p>I hold, that in contemplation of universal law, and of the Constitution, the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments. It is safe to assert that no government proper, ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination. Continue to<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;265</span>
execute all the express provisions of our national Constitution, and the Union will endure forever---it being impossible to destroy it, except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself.</p>
<p>Again, if the United States be not a government proper, but an association of States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a contract, be peaceably unmade, by less than all the parties who made it? One party to a contract may violate it---break it, so to speak; but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it?</p>
<p>Descending from these general principles, we find the proposition that, in legal contemplation, the Union is perpetual, confirmed by the history of the Union itself. The Union is much older than the Constitution. It was formed in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774. It was matured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776. It was further matured<span class="ptr"><a name="4_265_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_265_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[12]</a></span> and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation in 1778. And finally, in 1787, one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the Constitution, was ``<span class="rend-i">to form a more perfect union</span>.''</p>
<p>But if destruction of the Union, by one, or by a part only, of the States, be lawfully possible, the Union is <span class="rend-i">less</span> perfect than before<span class="ptr"><a name="4_265_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_265_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[13]</a></span> the Constitution,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_265_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_265_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[14]</a></span> having lost the vital element of perpetuity.</p>
<p>It follows from these views that no State, upon its own mere motion, can lawfully get out of the Union,---that <span class="rend-i">resolves</span> and <span class="rend-i">ordinances</span> to that effect are legally void;<span class="ptr"><a name="4_265_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_265_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[15]</a></span> and that acts of violence, within any State or States, against the authority of the United States, are insurrectionary or revolutionary,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_265_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_265_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[16]</a></span> according to circumstances.</p>
<p>I<span class="ptr"><a name="4_265_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_265_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[17]</a></span> therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws, the Union is unbroken; and, to the extent of my ability, I shall take care, as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States. Doing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part; and I shall perform it, so far as practicable, unless my rightful masters, the American people, shall withhold the requisite means, or, in some authoritative manner,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_265_7"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_265_7;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[18]</a></span> direct the contrary. I trust this<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;266</span>
will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the declared purpose of the Union that it <span class="rend-i">will</span><span class="ptr"><a name="4_266_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_266_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[19]</a></span> constitutionally defend, and maintain itself.</p>
<p>In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there shall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority. The<span class="ptr"><a name="4_266_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_266_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[20]</a></span> power the confided to me, will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property, and places belonging to the government, and to collect the duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects, there will be no invasion---no using of force against, or among the people anywhere. Where hostility to the United States, in any interior locality, shall be so great and so universal, as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object. While the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating, and so nearly impracticable with all, that I deem it better to forego, for the time, the uses of such offices.</p>
<p>The mails, unless repelled,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_266_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_266_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[21]</a></span> will continue to be furnished in all parts of the Union. So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection. The<span class="ptr"><a name="4_266_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_266_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[22]</a></span> course here indicated will be followed, unless current events, and experience, shall show a modification, or change, to be proper; and in every case and exigency, my best discretion will be exercised, according to circumstances actually existing, and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles, and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections.</p>
<p>That there are persons in one section, or another<span class="ptr"><a name="4_266_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_266_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[23]</a></span> who seek to destroy the Union at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will neither affirm or deny; but if there be such, I need address no word to them. To those, however, who really love the Union, may I not speak?</p>
<p>Before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_266_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_266_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[24]</a></span> with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes, would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it? Will you<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;267</span>
hazard so desperate a step, while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from, have no real existence? Will you, while the certain ills you fly to, are greater than all the real ones you fly from? Will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake?</p>
<p>All profess to be content in the Union, if all constitutional rights can be maintained. Is it true, then, that any<span class="ptr"><a name="4_267_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_267_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[25]</a></span> right, plainly written in the Constitution, has been denied? I think not. Happily the human mind is so constituted,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_267_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_267_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[26]</a></span> that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this. Think, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the Constitution has ever been denied. If, by the mere force of numbers, a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right, it might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution---certainly would, if such right were a vital one.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_267_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_267_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[27]</a></span> But such is not our case. All the vital rights of minorities, and of individuals, are so plainly assured to them, by affirmations and negations, guarranties and prohibitions,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_267_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_267_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[28]</a></span> in the Constitution, that controversies never arise concerning them. But no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every<span class="ptr"><a name="4_267_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_267_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[29]</a></span> question which may occur in practical administration. No foresight can anticipate, nor any document of reasonable length contain express provisions for all possible questions. Shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or by State authority? The Constitution does not expressly say. <span class="rend-i">May</span> Congress prohibit slavery in the territories? The Constitution does not expressly say. <span class="rend-i">Must</span> Congress protect slavery in the territories? The Constitution does not expressly say.</p>
<p>From questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies, and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities. If the minority will not acquiesce,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_267_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_267_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[30]</a></span> the majority must, or the government must cease. There is no other alternative; for continuing the government, is acquiescence<span class="ptr"><a name="4_267_7"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_267_7;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[31]</a></span> on one side or the other. If a minority, in such case, will secede rather than acquiesce,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_267_8"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_267_8;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[32]</a></span> they make a precedent which, in turn, will divide and ruin them; for a minority of their own<span class="ptr"><a name="4_267_9"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_267_9;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[33]</a></span> will secede from them, whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority. For instance,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_267_10"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_267_10;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[34]</a></span><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;268</span>
why may not any portion of a new confederacy, a year or two hence, arbitrarily secede again, precisely as portions of the present Union now claim to secede from it. All who cherish disunion sentiments, are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this. Is there such perfect identity of interests among the States to compose a new<span class="ptr"><a name="4_268_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_268_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[35]</a></span> Union, as to produce harmony only, and prevent renewed secession?</p>
<p>Plainly, the central idea of secession, is the essence of anarchy. A<span class="ptr"><a name="4_268_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_268_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[36]</a></span> majority, held in restraint by constitutional checks, and limitations, and always changing easily, with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people. Whoever rejects it, does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity is impossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement, is wholly inadmissable; so that, rejecting the majority principle, anarchy, or despotism in some form, is all that is left.</p>
<p>I do not forget the position assumed by some, that constitutional questions are to be decided by the Supreme Court; nor do I deny that such decisions must be binding in any case, upon the parties to a suit, as to the object of that<span class="ptr"><a name="4_268_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_268_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[37]</a></span> suit, while<span class="ptr"><a name="4_268_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_268_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[38]</a></span> they are also entitled to very high respect and consideration, in all paralel cases, by all other departments of the government. And while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect following it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance that it may be over-ruled, and never become a precedent for other cases, can better be borne than<span class="ptr"><a name="4_268_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_268_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[39]</a></span> could the evils of a different practice. At the same time the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government, upon vital questions, affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made, in ordinary litigation between parties, in personal actions, the people will have ceased, to be their own rulers, having, to that extent, practically resigned their government, into the hands of that eminent tribunal. Nor is there, in this view, any assault upon the court, or the judges. It is a duty, from which they may not shrink, to decide cases properly brought before them; and it is no fault of theirs, if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes.</p>
<p>One section of our country<span class="ptr"><a name="4_268_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_268_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[40]</a></span> believes slavery is <span class="rend-i">right</span>, and ought<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;269</span>
to be extended, while the other believes it is <span class="rend-i">wrong</span>, and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive slave clause of the Constitution, and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade, are each as well enforced, perhaps,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_269_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_269_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[41]</a></span> as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports<span class="ptr"><a name="4_269_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_269_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[42]</a></span> the law itself. The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each. This, I think, cannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases <span class="rend-i">after</span> the separation of the sections, than before. The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately<span class="ptr"><a name="4_269_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_269_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[43]</a></span> revived without restriction, in one section; while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all, by the other.</p>
<p>Physically speaking, we cannot separate. We cannot remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them. A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out of the presence, and beyond the reach of each other; but the different parts of our country cannot do this. They cannot but remain face to face; and intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them. Is it possible then<span class="ptr"><a name="4_269_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_269_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[44]</a></span> to make that intercourse more advantageous, or more<span class="ptr"><a name="4_269_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_269_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[45]</a></span> satisfactory, <span class="rend-i">after</span> separation than <span class="rend-i">before?</span> Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens, than laws can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides, and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions, as to terms of intercourse, are again upon you.</p>
<p>This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise their <span class="rend-i">constitutional</span> right of amending it, or their <span class="rend-i">revolutionary</span> right to dismember, or overthrow it. I<span class="ptr"><a name="4_269_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_269_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[46]</a></span> can not be ignorant of the fact that many worthy, and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the national constitution amended. While I make no recommendation of amendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself; and I should, under existing circumstances, favor, rather than oppose, a fair oppertunity being afforded the people to act upon it.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;270</span>I will venture to add that, to me, the convention mode seems preferable, in that it allows amendments to originate with the people themselves, instead of only permitting them to take, or reject, propositions, originated by others, not especially chosen for the purpose, and which might not be precisely such, as they would wish to either accept or refuse. I understand a proposed amendment to the Constitution---which amendment, however, I have not seen, has passed Congress, to the effect that the federal government, shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the States, including that of persons held to service. To avoid misconstruction of what I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendments, so far as to say that, holding such a provision to now be implied constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express, and irrevocable.</p>
<p>The Chief Magistrate derives all his authority from the people, and they have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the States. The people themselves can do this also<span class="ptr"><a name="4_270_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_270_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[47]</a></span> if they choose; but the executive, as such, has nothing to do with it. His duty is to administer the present government, as it came to his hands, and to transmit it, unimpaired by him, to his successor.</p>
<p>Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people? Is there any better, or equal hope, in the world? In our present differences, is either party without faith of being<span class="ptr"><a name="4_270_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_270_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[48]</a></span> in the right?

<p>By the frame of the government under which we live, this same people have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief; and have, with equal wisdom, provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very short intervals.</p>
<p>While the people<span class="ptr"><a name="4_270_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_270_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[50]</a></span> retain their virtue, and vigilence, no administration, by any extreme of wickedness or folly, can very seriously injure the government, in the short space of four years.</p>
<p>My countrymen, one and all,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_270_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_270_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[51]</a></span> think calmly and <span class="rend-i">well</span>, upon this whole subject. Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_270_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_270_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[52]</a></span> If there be an object to <span class="rend-i">hurry</span> any of you, in hot haste, to a step which<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;271</span>
you would never take <span class="rend-i">deliberately</span>, that object will be frustrated by taking time; but no good object can be frustrated by it. Such of you as are now dissatisfied, still have the old Constitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point, the laws of your own framing under it; while the new administration will have no immediate power, if it would, to change either. If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied, hold the right side in the dispute, there still is no single good reason for precipitate action. Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance on Him, who has never yet forsaken this favored land, are still competent to adjust, in the best way, all our present difficulty.</p>
<p>In <span class="rend-i">your</span> hands, my dissatisfied fellow countrymen, and not in <span class="rend-i">mine</span>, is the momentous issue of civil war. The government will not assail <span class="rend-i">you</span>.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_271_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_271_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[53]</a></span> You can have no conflict, without being yourselves the aggressors. <span class="rend-i">You</span> have no oath registered in Heaven to destroy the government, while <span class="rend-i">I</span> shall have the most solemn one to ``preserve, protect and defend'' it.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_271_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_271_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[54]</a></span></p>
<p>I am loth to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, streching from every battle-field, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.</p>

I am informed that you are mostly citizens of New-York. [Cries of ``All,'' ``all.''] You all appear to be very happy. May I hope that the public expression which I have this day given to my sentiments, may have contributed in some degree to your happiness. [Emphatic exclamations of assent.] As far as I am concerned, the loyal citizens of every State, and of every section, shall have no cause to feel any other sentiment. [Cries of ``Good,'' ``Good.''] As towards the disaffected portion of our fellow-citizens, I will say, as every good man throughout the country must feel, that there will be more rejoicing over one sheep that is lost, and is found, than over the ninety-and-nine which have gone not astray. [Great cheering.] And now, my friends, as I have risen from the dinner-table to see you, you will excuse me for the brevity of my remarks, and permit me again to thank you heartily, and cordially, for this pleasant visit, as I rejoin those who await my return.</p>

You seem to be in good humor after the proceedings of the day. If I have been fortunate enough to contribute to your good feeling I am glad, and I shall rejoice if what I have said may cause the friends of the Union South to feel good when they hear it. I made it as near right as I could, in my poor humble judgment, and in accordance with the principles of the Constitution and the perpetuity of freedom. [Cheers.] I made it as well for the good of those who lived south of Mason and Dixon's line as you who live north of that line.

<p>[2]&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonel Elmer Ephraim Ellsworth was a young law student of Chicago who in 1860 had raised and trained a company of Zouaves which became famous for drill exhibitions. On Lincoln's invitation he accompanied the presidential party to Washington. Being inclined to active military service instead of a clerkship, he proceeded to New York to organize a Zouave regiment. His spectacular death at Alexandria, Virginia, occurred May 24, 1861, when he was shot by the proprietor of a hotel from the roof of which he was removing a Confederate flag. He is usually credited with being the first casualty of the Civil War. See Lincoln's letter to Ellsworth's parents, May 25, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>.

<p><span class="rend-i">Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Pennsylvania Delegation:</span>---As I have so frequently said<span class="ptr"><a name="4_273_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_273_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> heretofore, when I have had occasion to address the people of the Keystone, in my visits to that<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;274</span></p>
<p>State, I can now but repeat the assurance of my gratification at the support you gave me at the late election, and at the promise of a continuation of that support which is now tendered to me.</p>
<p>Allusion has been made to the hope that you entertain that you have a President and a Government. In respect to that I wish to say to you, that in the position I have assumed I wish to do no more than I have ever given reason to believe I would do. I do not wish you to believe that I assume to be any better than others who have gone before me. I prefer rather to have it understood that if we ever have a Government on the principles we prefer, we should remember while we exercise our opinion, that others have also rights to the exercise of their opinions, and we should endeavor to allow these rights, and act in such a manner as to create no bad feeling. I hope we have a Government and a President. I hope and wish it to be understood that there may be allusion to no unpleasant differences.</p>
<p>We must remember that the people of all the States are entitled to all the privileges and immunities of the citizens of the several States. We should bear this in mind, and act in such a way as to say nothing insulting or irritating. I would inculcate this idea, so that we may not, like Pharisees, set ourselves up to be better than other people.</p>
<p>Now my friends, my public duties are pressing today, and will prevent my giving more time to you. Indeed, I should not have left them now, but I could not well deny myself to so large and respectable a body.</p>

<p>I am thankful for this renewed assurance of kind feeling, and confidence, and support of the Old Bay State, in so far as you, Mr. Chairman, have expressed, in behalf of those whom you represent, your sanction of what I have enunciated in my inaugural address. This is very grateful to my feelings. The subject was one of great delicacy, in presenting views at the opening of an administration under the peculiar circumstances attending my entrance upon the<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;275</span>
official duties connected with the Government. I studied all the points with great anxiety, and have presented them with whatever of ability and sense of justice I could bring to bear.</p>
<p>If it meet the approbation of our good friends in Massachusetts, I shall be exceedingly gratified; while I hope it will meet the approbation of friends everywhere. I am thankful for the expressions of those who have voted with us; and like every other man of you, I like them certainly as I do others. [Laughter.] As President, in the administration of the Government, I hope to be man enough not to know one citizen of the United States from another, [cries of ``Good!''] nor one section from another.

I have so often addressed the people of Illinois, and so frequently in their hearing said all that I know how to say, that I am a little more troubled to know what not to say upon this occasion than I ever have been. [Laughter.] We are all rejoiced, doubtless, at the success so far of the principles of Government which we have regarded as being just and right; which, as I hope, we have contended for only because we so regarded them, not because of any selfishness or sectionalism, or anything calculated to wrong any other of our citizens or section of the country. I certainly can say for myself, and I think for the rest of you, that these are the sentiments which have actuated all of us. And having advanced as far as we have in this cause, I have to request of you, which I think I need hardly do, either, that you will sustain me in trying to do ample and full justice to all the people of the different sections of this great Confederacy. [Applause.] In saying this, I think I have said as much as I know how to say upon this occasion. [Laughter and applause.]</p>

I have no time to make a speech, even if I desired to do so, but I wish to express the pleasure I have experienced in contemplating your enterprising people, and watching the rapid advance of everything desirable in that young sister in the Republic-Minnesota. You may some of you differ from me, and I may be wrong, but, according to my judgment, the people up your way have very correct political views, and so in that particular, also, I give them my approbation. (Laughter.) And while their political sentiments accord with mine, I have no reason to doubt that they look upon the rights of their brethren further South, as being entirely equal to their own. (Applause.) and that while Minnesota will maintain her principles, she will require and permit nothing to be done, that does not favor the maintenance of the Constitution and fidelity to the Union.

I meant to say, and now do say, you were most honorably and amply recommended; and a tender of the appointment was not withheld on any ground disparaging to you. Nor was it withheld, in any part, because of anything happening in 1858---indeed, I should have decided as I did, easier than I did, had that matter never existed. I had partly made up my mind in favor of Mr. Smith---not conclusively of course---before your name was mentioned in that connection. When you were brought forward I said ``Colfax is a young man---is already in position---is running a brilliant career, and is sure of a bright future in any event.'' ``With Smith, it is now or never.'' I considered either abundantly competent, and decided on the ground I have stated. I now have to beg that you will not do me the injustice to suppose, for a moment, that I remembered any thing against you in malice. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN</p>

The lengthy replies in the Lincoln Papers are abridged as follows: (1) Seward, March 15--- ``If it were possible to peacefully provision Fort Sumter, of course I should answer, that it would be both unwise and inhuman not to attempt it. But the facts of the case are known to be, that the attempt must be made with the employment of military and marine force, which would provoke combat, and probably initiate a civil war. . . . I would not provoke war in any way <span class="rend-i">now</span>. . . . '' (2) Chase, March 16--- ``. . . . If the attempt will so inflame civil war as to involve an immediate necessity for the enlistment of armies . . . I cannot advise it. . . . But it seems to me highly improbable that the attempt . . . will produce such consequences. . . . I return, therefore, an affirmative answer. . . . '' (3) Cameron, March 16--- `` . . . it would be unwise now to make such an attempt. . . . I am greatly influenced by the opinions of the Army officers who have expressed themselves on the subject, and who seem to concur that it is, perhaps, now impossible to succor that fort, substantially, if at all. . . . All the officers within Fort Sumter, together with Generals Scott and Totten, express this opinion. . . . '' (4) Welles, March 15--- ``The question has two aspects, one military, the other political. The military gentlemen . . . represent that it would be unwise . . . and I am not disposed to controvert their opinions. . . . In a political view, I entertain doubts of the wisdom of the measure. . . . I do not . . . think it wise. . . . '' (5) Smith, March 16--- ``After a careful consideration of the opinions of Gens. Scott and Totten, and also those of Commodore String[h]am and Mr. Fox . . . I have arrived at the conclusion that the probabilities are in favor of the success of the proposed enterprise, so far as to secure the landing of the vessels at the Fort, but . . . . it would not be wise under all the circumstances. . . .

The ambitious leaders of the late Democratic party have availed themselves . . . to found a Military Government in the Seceding States. To the connivance of the late administration it is due alone that this Rebellion has been enabled to attain its present proportions. . . .

<p>Some considerations in favor of withdrawing the Troops from Fort Sumpter, by President Lincoln.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;289</span>1st. The Fort cannot be permanently held without reinforcement.</p>
<p>This point is too apparent too [<span class="rend-i">sic</span>] need proof</p>
<p>The cutting off supplies and consequent starvation, not to mention disease, would compel surrender in a few months at farthest, without firing a gun</p>
<p>2 The Fort cannot now be re-inforced without a large armament, involving of course a bloody conflict and great exasperation on both sides, and when re-inforced can only be held by sufficient number to garrison the post and to keep open communication with it by means of the harbor.</p>
<p>3. The Fort in the present condition of affairs is of inconsiderable military value, for: It is not necessary for the Federal Government to hold it in order to protect the City of Charleston from foreign invasion, nor: Is it available under existing circumstances for the purpose of collecting the revenue: and, It is difficult to see how the possession of the Fort by the Secessionists can be rendered a means of annoyance to the Federal Government. Every purpose for which the fort can now be made available would be better subserved by Ships of War, outside the harbor.</p>
<p>4 The abandonment of the Post would remove a source of irritation of the Southern people and deprive the secession movement of one of its most powerful stimulants.</p>
<p>5 It would indicate both an independent and a conservative position on part of the new administration, and would gratify and encourage those, who while friendly to the Union are yet reluctant to see extreme measures pursued.</p>
<p>6 It would tend to confound and embarrass those enemies of the Union both at the North and South who have relied on the cry of ``Coercion'' as a means of keeping up the excitement against the Republican Party.</p>
<p>7 If the garrison should, while in an enfeebled condition be successfully attacked, or from want of proper supplies should be cut off by disuse the administration would be held responsible for it and this fact would be used by their opponents with great effect.</p>
<p>8 The moral advantage to the Secessionists of a successful attack would be very great.</p>
<p>Objections</p>
<p>1st The danger of demoralizing the Republican Party by a measure which might seem to many to indicate timidity or in common parlance, ``want of pluck.''</p>
<p>That this may be the first impression is probable but if the measure is justified upon the double ground of the small importance<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;290</span>
of the post in a military point of view and the desire to conciliate wherever this can be safely done a second thought will discover the wisdom of the course, and increase rather than diminish the confidence of the party in its leaders.</p>
<p>2d The danger of the movement being construed by the Secessionists as a yielding from necessity, and in so far a victory on their part</p>

It may be a copy of a memorandum submitted to the cabinet, or a resume of conflicting views as Lincoln orally presented them to the cabinet. Although the first and third pages are dated March 18, 1861, this date seems to have been added later. There is no Lincoln autograph in the Lincoln Papers that resembles the manuscript, but its presence in the Welles Papers seems to justify its inclusion here.

<p>I was nearly as sorry as you can be at not being able to give Mr. Luce the appointment you desired for him. Of course I <span class="rend-i">could</span> have done it; but it would have been against the united, earnest, and, I add, angry protest of the republican delegation of Minnesota, in which state the office is located.

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; AD, DNA FS RG 59, Appointments, Box 370. William B. Richmond was not appointed to either post, but on December 23, Lincoln nominated him for the consulship at Tunis upon John H.

Richmond's nomination in favor of Amos Perry of Rhode Island, who was confirmed April 15 (<span class="rend-i">Executive Journal</span>). The persons listed as recommending Richmond were Senator James F. Simmons of Rhode Island, Andrew Johnson, John Bell, Representative Horace Maynard, and Representative Thomas A. R. Nelson---all of Tennessee. Lincoln was in error in listing Senator Simmons among William W. Richmond's supporters, having confused the latter with William W. Richmond, also an applicant for the Paris consulship. Both William B. of Tennessee and William W. of New Orleans had resided abroad for some years. Both were well recommended, loyal, and apparently of unusual competence. But neither was appointed because of the confusion of identity.

<p>general agreement, but our failure to locate the original documents issued in connection with the <span class="rend-i">Powhatan</span> episode leaves much to be desired in clarifying the circumstances which occasioned the several communications. The fact that the text of these communications as printed in Hertz, II, 825-28, is either badly garbled or derived from an unknown if authentic source, further complicates the matter. It seems scarcely probable that Lincoln would have written two different letters in each case, at once so verbally different, yet substantially the same. Hence the editors have relied on the <span class="rend-i">Official Records</span> for the texts here reproduced. Lincoln's secret orders to Foote, Mercer, and Porter were issued on Seward's advice, unknown to the Navy Department.

<div class="opener">Hon: W. H. Seward: Executive Mansion April 1, 1861</div>
<p>My dear Sir: Since parting with you I have been considering your paper dated this day, and entitled ``Some thoughts for the President's consideration.'' The first proposition in it is, ``1st. We are at the end of a month's administration, and yet without a policy, either domestic or foreign.''</p>
<p>At the <span class="rend-i">beginning</span> of that month, in the inaugeral, I said ``The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the government, and to collect the duties, and imposts.'' This had your distinct approval at the time; and, taken in connection with the order I immediately gave General Scott, directing him to employ every means in his power to strengthen and hold the forts, comprises the exact domestic policy you now urge, with the single exception, that it does not propose to abandon Fort Sumpter.</p>
<p>Again, I do not perceive how the re-inforcement of Fort Sumpter would be done on a slavery, or party issue, while that of Fort Pickens would be on a more national, and patriotic one.</p>
<p>The news received yesterday in regard to St. Domingo, certainly brings a new item within the range of our foreign policy;<span class="ptr"><a name="4_316_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_316_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> but up to that time we have been preparing circulars, and instructions to ministers, and the like, all in perfect harmony, without even a suggestion that we had no foreign policy.</p>
<p>Upon your closing propositions, that ``whatever policy we adopt, there must be an energetic prossecution of it''</p>
<p>``For this purpose it must be somebody's business to pursue and direct it incessantly''</p>
<p>``Either the President must do it himself, and be all the while active in it, or''</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;317</span>``Devolve it on some member of his cabinet''</p>
<p>``Once adopted, debates on it must end, and all agree and abide'' I remark that if this must be done, <span class="rend-i">I</span> must do it. When a general line of policy is adopted, I apprehend there is no danger of its being changed without good reason, or continuing to be a subject of unnecessary debate; still, upon points arising in its progress, I wish, and suppose I am entitled to have the advice of all the cabinet. Your Obt. Servt. A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS, DLC-RTL. The envelope with the letter is addressed by Lincoln ``Hon. W. H. Seward/Present.'' There is no reply in the Lincoln Papers. Lincoln may have handed the letter to Seward personally or sent it by messenger. If so, he must have requested its return. The fact that no biography of Seward mentions such a letter among the Seward Papers indicates that the document in the Lincoln Papers is probably the original which was never sent. The editors have doubts that the letter was presented to Seward at all. Having written it, Lincoln may have thought better of rebuking his secretary in writing and handled the matter orally. The memorandum to which Lincoln replied is in the handwriting of Frederick W. Seward, as follows:</p>
<p>``Some thoughts for the President's consideration</p>
<p>April 1. 1861.</p>
<p>``1st. We are at the end of a month's administration and yet without a policy either domestic or foreign.</p>
<p>``2d This, however, is not culpable, and it has been unavoidable. The presence of the Senate, with the need to meet applications for patronage have prevented attention to other and more grave matters.</p>
<p>``3d. But further delay to adopt and prosecute our policies for both domestic and foreign affairs would not only bring scandal on the Administration, but danger upon the country.</p>
<p>``4th. To do this we must dismiss the applicants for office. But how? I suggest that we make the local appointments forthwith, leaving foreign or general ones for ulterior and occasional action.</p>
<p>``5th. The policy---at home. I am aware that my views are singular, and perhaps not sufficiently explained. My system is built upon this <span class="rend-i">idea</span> as a ruling one, namely that we must</p>
<p>``<span class="rend-i">Change the question before the Public from one upon Slavery, or about Slavery</span></p>
<p>``for a question upon <span class="rend-i">Union or Disunion</span>.</p>
<p>``In other words, from what would be regarded as a Party question to one of <span class="rend-i">Patriotism or Union</span></p>
<p>``The occupation or evacuation of Fort Sumter, although not in fact a slavery, or a party question is so <span class="rend-i">regarded</span>. Witness, the temper manifested by the Republicans in the Free States, and even by Union men in the South.</p>
<p>``I would therefore terminate it as a safe means for changing the issue. I deem it fortunate that the last Administration created the necessity.</p>
<p>``For the rest. I would simultaneously defend and reinforce all the Forts in the Gulf, and have the Navy recalled from foreign stations to be prepared for a blockade. Put the Island of Key West under Martial Law</p>
<p>``This will raise distinctly the question of <span class="rend-i">Union</span> or <span class="rend-i">Disunion</span>. I would maintain every fort and possession in the South.</p>
<p>For <span class="rend-i">Foreign Nations</span>.</p>
<p>``I would demand explanations from <span class="rend-i">Spain</span> and France, categorically, at once.</p>
<p>``I would seek explanations from Great Britain and Russia, and send agents<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;318</span>
into <span class="rend-i">Canada, Mexico</span> and <span class="rend-i">Central America</span>, to rouse a vigorous continental <span class="rend-i">spirit of independence</span> on this continent against European intervention.</p>
<p>``And if satisfactory explanations are not received from Spain and France,</p>
<p>``Would convene Congress and declare war against them</p>
<p>``But whatever policy we adopt, there must be an energetic prosecution of it.</p>
<p>``For this purpose it must be somebody's business to pursue and direct it incessantly.</p>
<p>``Either the President must do it himself, and be all the while active in it; or</p>
<p>``Devolve it on some member of his Cabinet. Once adopted, debates on it must end, and all agree and abide.</p>
<p>``It is not in my especial province.</p>
<p>``But I neither seek to evade nor assume responsibility'' (DLC-RTL).</p>

<p>You will therefore hold out if possible till the arrival of the expedition.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;322</span>It is not, however, the intention of the President to subject your command to any danger or hardship beyond what, in your judgement, would be usual in military life; and he has entire confidence that you will act as becomes a patriot and a soldier, under all circumstances.</p>
<p>Whenever, if at all, in your judgment, to save yourself and command, a capitulation becomes a necessity, you are authorized to make it. [Respectfully SIMON CAMERON.]</p>

<p>Hon: William Ballard Preston, Alexander H. H. Stuart, &amp; George W. Randolph, Esq---</p>
<p>Gentlemen: As a committee of the Virginia convention, now in session, you present me a preamble and resolution, in these words:</p>
<p>Whereas,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_329_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_329_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> in the opinion of this Convention the uncertainty which prevails in the public mind as to the policy which the Federal Executive<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;330</span>
intends to pursue toward the seceded States is extremely injurious to the industrial and commercial interests of the country; tends to keep up an excitement which is unfavorable to the adjustment of pending difficulties, and threatens a disturbance of the public peace; therefore</p>
<p>Resolved, that a committee of three delegates be appointed by this Convention to wait upon the President of the United States, present to him this preamble and resolution, and respectfully ask of him to communicate to this Convention the policy which the Federal Executive intends to pursue in regard to the Confederate States.</p>
<p>Adopted by the Convention of the State of Virginia, Richmond, April 8th 1861</p>
<p>In pursuance of the foregoing resolution, the following delegates were appointed to constitute said committee.</p>
<p>Hon. William Ballard Preston.</p>
<p>Hon. Alexander H. H. Stuart.</p>
<p>George W. Randolph Esq.</p>
<p>JOHN JANNEY PRESIDENT</p>
<p>JNO. L. EUBANK SECRETARY.</p>
<p>In answer I have to say, that having, at the beginning of my official term, expressed my intended policy, as plainly as I was able, it is with deep regret, and some mortification, I now learn, that there is great, and injurious uncertainty, in the public mind, as to what that policy is, and what course I intend to pursue. Not having, as yet, seen occasion to change, it is now my purpose to pursue the course marked out in the inaugeral address. I commend a careful consideration of the whole document, as the best expression I can give of my purposes. As I then, and therein, said, I now repeat:</p>
<p>``The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess, the property, and places belonging to the Government, and to collect the duties, and imposts; but, beyond what is necessary for these objects, there will be no invasion---no using of force against, or among the people anywhere''</p>
<p>By the words ``property, and places, belonging to the Government'' I chiefly allude to the military posts, and property, which were in the possession of the Government when it came to my hands. But<span class="ptr"><a name="4_330_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_330_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> if, as now appears to be true, in pursuit of a purpose to drive the United States authority from these places, an unprovoked assault, has been made upon Fort-Sumpter, I shall hold myself at liberty to re-possess, if I can, like places which had been seized before the Government was devolved upon me.</p>
<p>And, in every event, I shall, to the extent of my ability, repel force by force.</p>
<p>In case it proves true, that Fort-Sumpter has been assaulted, as is reported, I shall perhaps, cause the United [States] mails to be<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;331</span>
withdrawn from all the States which claim to have seceded---believing that the commencement of actual war against the Government, justifies and possibly demands this.</p>
<p>I scarcely need to say that I consider the Military posts and property situated within the states, which claim to have seceded, as yet belonging to the Government of the United States, as much as they did before the supposed secession.</p>
<p>Whatever else I may do for the purpose, I shall not attempt to collect the duties, and imposts, by any armed invasion of any part of the country---not meaning by this, however, that I may not land a force, deemed necessary, to relieve a fort upon a border of the country. From the fact, that I have quoted a part of the inaugeral address, it must not be infered that I repudiate any other part, the whole of which I re-affirm, except so far as what I now say of the mails, may be regarded as a modification.</p>

The details, for this object, will be immediately communicated to the State authorities through the War Department.</p>

<p>I deem it proper to say that the first service assigned to the forces hereby called forth will probably be to re-possess the forts, places, and property which have been seized from the Union; and in every event, the utmost care will be observed, consistently with the objects aforesaid, to avoid any devastation, any destruction of, or interference with, property, or any disturbance of peaceful citizens in any part of the country.</p>

<p>Whereas an insurrection against the Government of the United States has broken out in the States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, and the laws of the United States for the collection of the revenue cannot be effectually executed therein conformably to that provision of the Constitution which requires duties to be uniform throughout the United States:</p>
<p>And whereas a combination of persons engaged in such insurrection, have threatened to grant pretended letters of marque to authorize the bearers thereof to commit assaults on the lives, vessels, and property of good citizens of the country lawfully engaged in commerce on the high seas, and in waters of the United States: And whereas an Executive Proclamation has been already issued, requiring the persons engaged in these disorderly proceedings to desist therefrom, calling out a militia force for the purpose of repressing the same, and convening Congress in extraordinary session, to deliberate and determine thereon:</p>
<p>Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, with a view to the same purposes before mentioned, and to the protection of the public peace, and the lives and property of quiet and orderly citizens pursuing their lawful occupations, until Congress shall have assembled and deliberated on the said unlawful<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;339</span>
proceedings, or until the same shall have ceased, have further deemed it advisable to set on foot a blockade of the ports within the States aforesaid, in pursuance of the laws of the United States, and of the law of Nations, in such case provided. For this purpose a competent force will be posted so as to prevent entrance and exit of vessels from the ports aforesaid. If, therefore, with a view to violate such blockade, a vessel shall approach, or shall attempt to leave either of the said ports, she will be duly warned by the Commander of one of the blockading vessels, who will endorse on her register the fact and date of such warning, and if the same vessel shall again attempt to enter or leave the blockaded port, she will be captured and sent to the nearest convenient port, for such proceedings against her and her cargo as prize, as may be deemed advisable.</p>
<p>And I hereby proclaim and declare that if any person, under the pretended authority of the said States, or under any other pretense, shall molest a vessel of the United States, or the persons or cargo on board of her, such person will be held amenable to the laws of the United States for the prevention and punishment of piracy.</p>
<p>In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<div class="opener">Lieutenant General Scott Washington, April 25--- 1861.</div>
<p>My dear Sir: The Maryland Legislature assembles to-morrow at Anapolis; and, not improbably, will take action to arm the people of that State against the United States. The question has been submitted to, and considered by me, whether it would not be justifiable, upon the ground of necessary defence, for you, as commander in Chief of the United States Army, to arrest, or disperse the members of that body. I think it would <span class="rend-i">not</span> be justifiable; nor, efficient for the desired object.</p>
<p>First, they have a clearly legal right to assemble; and, we can not know in advance, that their action will not be lawful, and peaceful. And if we wait until they shall <span class="rend-i">have</span> acted, their arrest, or dispersion, will not lessen the effect of their action.</p>
<p>Secondly, we <span class="rend-i">can</span> not permanently prevent their action. If we arrest them, we can not long hold them as prisoners; and when liberated, they will immediately re-assemble, and take their action. And, precisely the same if we simply disperse them. They will immediately re-assemble in some other place.</p>
<p>I therefore conclude that it is only left to the commanding General to watch, and await their action, which, if it shall be to arm their people against the United States, he is to adopt the most prompt, and efficient means to counteract, even, if necessary, to the bombardment of their cities---and in the extremest necessity, the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.

<p>I sincerely regret that the failure of the late attempt to provision Fort-Sumpter, should be the source of any annoyance to you. The practicability of your plan was not, in fact, brought to a test. By reason of a gale, well known in advance to be possible, and not improbable, the tugs, an essential part of the plan, never reached the ground; while, by an accident, for which you were in no wise responsible, and possibly I, to some extent was, you were deprived of a war vessel with her men, which you deemed of great importance to the enterprize.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_350_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_350_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;351</span>For a daring and dangerous enterprize, of a similar character, you would, to-day, be the man, of all my acquaintances, whom I would select.</p>

The proportions of each arm, and the details of enrollment and organization will be made known, through the Department of War.</p>

a maximum aggregate increase of twenty-two thousand, seven hundred and fourteen officers and enlisted men; the details of which increase will also be made known through the Department of War.</p>

<p>The call for volunteers hereby made, and the direction for the increase of the regular army, and for the enlistment of seamen hereby given, together with the plan of organization adopted for the volunteer and for the regular forces hereby authorized, will be submitted to Congress as soon as assembled.</p>
<p>In the meantime I earnestly invoke the cooperation of all good citizens in the measures hereby adopted, for the effectual suppression of unlawful violence, for the impartial enforcement of constitutional laws, and for the speediest possible restoration of peace and order and, with these, of happiness and prosperity throughout our country.</p>

<p>I have received and read with great sensibility the letter which as Regent Captains of the Republic of San Marino you addressed to me on the 29th of March last. I thank the Council of San Marino for the honor of citizenship they have conferred upon me.</p>
<p>Although your dominion is small, your State is nevertheless one of the most honored, in all history. It has by its experience demonstrated the truth, so full of encouragement to the friends of Humanity, that Government founded on Republican principles is capable of being so administered as to be secure and enduring.</p>
<p>You have kindly adverted to the trial through which this Republic is now passing. It is one of deep import. It involves the question whether a Representative republic, extended and aggrandized so much as to be safe against foreign enemies can save itself from the dangers of domestic faction. I have faith in a good result.</p>
<p>Wishing that your interesting State may endure and flourish forever, and that you may live long and enjoy the confidence and secure the gratitude of your fellow citizens, I pray God to have you in his holy keeping. Your Good Friend</p>

My dear Sir May 14. 1861</div>
<p>Some time ago, and before it was arranged for you to go West, as now, the question was upon us how arms sent to Cincinnati for Kentuckians, could surely be put in the hands of friends, and not of enemies; and, for this purpose, and without their knowledge, Messrs Crittenden, Guthrie, and Joshua F. Speed, bearer of this, or any one of them, were designated to distribute the arms, in their discretion. After you left here last week it occurred to us that you could perform this service as safely, and perhaps more expeditiously, by reason that you will be on the spot, and will not have to wait for the co-operation of any one; and a direction was accordingly sent to the parties forwarding the arms to Cincinnati. It now occurs further that the kind assitance of these gentlemen may still<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;369</span>
be valuable to you in this, and perhaps other matters; and when it shall so appear to you it is hoped you will avail yourself of it. Mr. Speed, though less known to the world than the other gentlemen, is far better known to me than either of them; and I have the utmost confidence in his loyalty and integrity, and also in his judgment on any subject which he professes to understand. I think you will find him a most agreeable companion, and at the same time a most valuable assistant in our common cause. Yours very truly</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS, DLC-Cameron Papers. Although the circumstances of mobilization were so complex, not to say chaotic, that any succinct statement of the conflict between the War Department and other branches of the government is open to criticism, the basic difficulty seems to have been that the Army wished to keep, logically enough, some semblance of an orderly promotion of regular officers and integration of troops, while Montgomery Blair, as well as the governors of the loyal states and numerous individual politicians were demanding wholesale acceptance of volunteer regiments and elected officers. Cameron repeatedly refused to accept volunteer regiments, and there was much opposition to the appointment of ``political'' generals. Also, in the border states, the conflict between the War Department's view of military rule and the political insistence upon subordination of the military to loyal local political exigencies brought about near chaos in such trouble spots as St. Louis. For further comment on Blair's opposition to the War Department policy see Lincoln to Cameron, May 16, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>, and note.</p>

They present the very difficulty which has embarrassed me from the first in the case: that Mr. Dennison has not the position in the public eye which would lead to the expectation of his receiving so high an office. I believe I have told you fully what it was, and is, that pressed me to appoint him: the urgent solicitation of an old friend<span class="ptr"><a name="4_373_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_373_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> who has served me all my life, and who has never before received or asked anything in return.

They are a class of debts which our clients ought to pay, and when we are personally dunned for them we sometimes hang fire. Besides, Mr. Dennison went far toward a satisfactory explanation of one case; and while Mr. --- intimated that there were other cases, he did not specify them.</p>

<p>My dear Sir: Yours of the 19th. is received. Your letter to the Secretary of War I have not seen.</p>
<p>To not shirk just responsibility, I suppose I ought to admit that I had much to do with the matter of which you complain.</p>
<p>The committee came here some time last week,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_375_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_375_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> saying there were fourteen Regiments in N.Y. city, not within the 38 you were organizing; that <span class="rend-i">something must</span> be done with them,---that they could not safely keep them longer, nor safely disband them. I could not see---can not yet---how it could wrong you, or the Regiments you were raising, for these 14 to move forward at once, provided yours, too, should be received when ready. But aware of my own ignorance in military matters, I sent to Genl. Scott to get his opinion whether the thing could be safely done, both as to the question of confusion, and also whether the Govt. could advantageously keep and use the <span class="rend-i">whole</span>. His answer was that the <span class="rend-i">whole</span> should come---of the 14[,]5 to come here, &amp; 9 to Fortress Monroe. I thought the whole difficulty was solved, and directed an order to be made accordingly. I was even pleased with it; because I had been trying for two weeks to begin the collecting of a force at Fortress Monroe, and it now appeared as if this would begin.</p>
<p>Next day &amp; after the committee had gone, I was brought to fear that a squabble was to arise between you and the committee, by which neither your Regiments nor theirs, would move in any reasonable time; to avoid which, I wrote one of the committee---Mr. Russell---to send them at once.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_375_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_375_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span></p>
<p>I am very loth to do any wrong; but I do not see yet wherein this was a wrong.</p>
<p>I certainly did not know that any Regiments especially under your control were to be sent forward by the committee; but I do not perceive the <span class="rend-i">substantial</span> wrong, even in such a case.

<div class="opener">Department of State,<br>
Sir: Washington, May 21st 1861<br>
</div>
<p>Mr. Dallas in a brief dispatch of May 2d. (No. 333) tells us that Lord John Russell recently requested an interview with him on account of the solicitude which His Lordship felt concerning the effect of certain measures represented as likely to be adopted by the President. In that conversation the British Secretary told Mr. Dallas that the three Representatives of the Southern Confederacy were then in London, that Lord John Russell had not yet seen were them, but that he was not unwilling to see them unofficially. He farther informed Mr. Dallas that an understanding exists between the British and French Governments which would lead both to take one and the same course as to recognition. His Lordship then referred to the rumor of a meditated blockade by us of Southern ports and a discontinuance of them as ports, of entry. Mr. Dallas answered that he knew nothing on those topics and therefore could say nothing. He added that you were expected to arrive in two weeks. Upon this statement Lord John Russell acquiesced in the<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;377</span>
expediency of waiting for the full knowledge you were expected to bring.</p>
<p>Mr. Dallas transmitted to us some newspaper reports of Ministerial explanations made in Parliament.</p>
<p>You will base no proceedings on parliamentary debates farther than to seek explanations when necessary and communicate them to this Department. We intend to have a clear and simple record of whatever issue may arise between us and Great Britain.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_377_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_377_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>The President [is surprised and grieved] <span class="rend-i">regrets</span> that Mr. Dallas did not protest against the proposed unofficial intercourse between the British Government and the missionaries of the insurgents, [as well as against the demand for explanations made by the British Government].<span class="ptr"><a name="4_377_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_377_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> It is due however to Mr. Dallas to say that our instructions had been given only to you and not to him, and that his loyalty and fidelity, too rare in these times, [among our late representatives abroad, are confessed and]<span class="ptr"><a name="4_377_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_377_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[4]</a></span><span class="rend-i">are</span> appreciated.</p>
<p>Intercourse of any kind with the so-called Commissioners is liable to be construed as a recognition of the authority which appointed them. Such intercourse would be none the less [wrongful] <span class="rend-i">hurtful</span> to us, for being called unofficial, and it might be even more injurious, because we should have no means of knowing what points might be resolved by it. Moreover, unofficial intercourse is useless and meaningless, if it is not expected to ripen into official intercourse and direct recognition. It is left doubtful here whether the proposed unofficial intercourse has yet actually begun. Your own [present] <span class="rend-i">antecedent</span> instructions are deemed explicit enough, and it is hoped that you have not misunderstood them. You will in any event desist from all intercourse whatever, unofficial as well as official with the British Government, so long as it shall continue intercourse of either kind with the domestic enemies of this country; [confining yourself simply to a delivery of a copy of this paper to the Secretary of State. After doing this]<span class="ptr"><a name="4_377_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_377_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[5]</a></span><span class="rend-i">when intercourse shall have been arrested for this cause</span>, you will communicate with this Department and receive further directions.</p>
<p>Lord John Russell has informed us of an understanding between the British and French Governments that they will act together in regard to our affairs. This communication however loses something of its value from the circumstance that the communication was withheld until after knowledge of the fact had been acquired by us from other sources. We know also another fact that has not yet<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;378</span>
been officially communicated to us namely that other European States are apprized by France and England of their agreement and are expected to concur with or follow them in whatever measures they adopt on the subject of recognition. The United States have been impartial and just in all their conduct towards the several nations of Europe. They will not complain however of the combination now announced by the two leading powers, although they think they had a right to expect a more independent if not a more friendly course from each of them. You will take no notice of that or any other alliance. Whenever the European governments shall see fit to communicate directly with us we shall be as heretofore frank and explicit in our reply.</p>
<p>As to the blockade, you will say that by [the] <span class="rend-i">our own</span> laws [of nature] and <span class="rend-i">the laws</span> [<span class="rend-i">of nature and the laws</span>]<span class="ptr"><a name="4_378_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_378_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[6]</a></span> of nations this government has a clear right to suppress insurrection. An exclusion of commerce from national ports which have been seized by the insurgents, in the equitable form of blockade, is a proper means to that end. You will not insist<span class="ptr"><a name="4_378_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_378_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[7]</a></span> that our blockade is to be respected if it be not maintained by a competent force---but passing by <span class="rend-i">any immaterial question</span><span class="ptr"><a name="4_378_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_378_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[8]</a></span> that question as not now a practical or at least an urgent one you will add that the blockade is now and it will continue to be so maintained, and therefore we expect it to be respected by Great Britain. You will add that we have already revoked the exequatur of a Russian Consul who had enlisted in the Military service of the insurgents and we shall dismiss or demand the recall of every foreign agent, Consular or Diplomatic who shall either disobey the Federal laws or disown the Federal authority.</p>
<p>As to the recognition of the so called Southern Confederacy it is not to be made a subject of technical definition. It is of course direct<span class="ptr"><a name="4_378_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_378_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[9]</a></span> recognition to publish an acknowledgment of the sovereignty and independence of a new power. It is direct recognition to receive its ambassadors Ministers agents or commissioners officially. A concession of belligerent rights is liable to be construed as a recognition of them. No one of these proceedings will [be borne] <span class="rend-i">pass unnoticed</span><span class="ptr"><a name="4_378_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_378_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[10]</a></span> by the United States in this case.</p>
<p>Hitherto recognition has been moved only on the assumption that the so-called Confederate States are de facto a self sustaining<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;379</span>
power. Now after long forbearance, designed to soothe discontent and avert the need of civil war, the land and naval forces of the United States have been put in motion to repress the insurrection. The true character of the pretended new State is at once revealed. It is seen to be a Power existing in pronunciamento only. It has never won a field. It has obtained no forts that were not virtually betrayed into its hands or seized in breach of trust. It commands not a single port on the coast nor any highway out from its pretended Capital by Land. Under these circumstances Great Britain is called upon to intervene and give it body and independence by resisting our measures of suppression. British recognition would be British intervention to create within our own territory a hostile State by overthrowing this Republic itself. [When this act of intervention is distinctly performed, we, from that hour, shall cease to be friends and (become once more, as we have twice before been), be forced to [become] enemies of Great Britain.]<span class="ptr"><a name="4_379_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_379_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[11]</a></span></p>
<p>As to the treatment of privateers in the insurgent service you will say that this is a question exclusively our own. We treat them as pirates. They are our own citizens, or persons employed by our citizens, preying on the commerce of our country. If Great Britain shall choose to recognise them as lawful belligerents, and give them shelter from our pursuit and punishment, the law of nations afford an adequate and proper remedy [and we shall avail ourselves of it.]<span class="ptr"><a name="4_379_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_379_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[12]</a></span><span class="rend-i">And while you need not to say this in advance, be sure that you say nothing inconsistent with it</span>.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_379_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_379_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[13]</a></span></p>
<p>Happily, however Her Britannic Majesty's Government can avoid all these difficulties. It invited us in 1856 to accede to the declaration of the Congress of Paris, of which body Great Britain was herself a member, abolishing privateering everywhere in all cases and for ever. You <span class="rend-i">already</span> have our authority to propose to her our accession to that declaration. If she refuse to receive it it can only be because she is willing to become the patron of privateering when aimed at our devastation.</p>
<p>These positions are not elaborately defended now, because to vindicate them would imply a possibility of our waiving them.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_379_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_379_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[14]</a></span>We are not insensible of the grave importance of this occasion.<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;380</span></p>
<p>We see how upon the result of the debate in which we are engaged, a war may ensue, between the United States and one, two, or even more European nations. War in any case is as exceptionable from the habits as it is revolting from the sentiments of the American people. But if it come it will be fully seen that it results from the action of Great Britain, not our own, that Great Britain will have decided to fraternize with our domestic enemy either without waiting to hear from you our remonstrances and our warnings or after having heard them. War in defence of national life is not immoral, and war in defence of independence is an inevitable part of the discipline of nations.</p>
<p>The dispute will be between the European and the American branches of the British race. All who belong to that race will especially deprecate it; as they ought. It may well be believed that men of every race and kindred will deplore it. A war not unlike it between the same parties occurred at the close of the last century. Europe atoned by forty years of suffering for the error that Great Britain committed in provoking that contest. If that nation shall now repeat the same great error, the social convulsions which will follow may not be so long but they will be more general. When they shall have ceased it will, we think, be seen, whatever may have been the fortunes of other nations that it is not the United States that will have come out of them with its precious constitution altered or its honestly obtained dominion in any degree abridged. Great Britain has but to wait a few months and all her present inconveniences will cease with all our own troubles. If she take a different course she will calculate for herself the ultimate as well as the immediate consequences, and will consider what position she will hold when she shall have forever lost the sympathies and the affections of the only nation on whose sympathies and affections she has a natural claim. In making that calculation she will do well to remember that in the controversy she proposes to open we shall be actuated by neither pride, nor passion, nor cupidity, nor ambition; but we shall stand simply on the principle of self preservation and that our cause will involve the independence of nations and the rights of human nature.</p>
<p>I am, sir, respectfully your obedient servant, W.H.S.</p>

<p>The President, having advanced to the front of the platform, was enthusiastically greeted from the crowd. He said:---</p>
<p>SIR---Permit me to say, in response to your invitation, that I am very happy, upon this, as upon all occasions, to be an humble instrument in forwarding the very worthy object which you have expressed. I therefore shall take pleasure in performing the part assigned me upon this occasion, and I hope in a satisfactory manner. I suppose that extended remarks are not expected of me at this time, but that it is<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;383</span>
desired by all that we shall proceed at once to the work in hand, of raising our glorious national ensign to the proud and lofty eminence from which it is designed to have it wave. I am now ready to perform my part.</p>
<p>The ropes attached to the staff, and on which the flag was fastened, were then placed in the hands of the President, when, amid the most deafening applause from the crowd below, the flag was raised to its prominent position. There being but a slight breeze at the time of its reaching its place at the top of the staff, it remained for a moment or two motionless, when suddenly, a gentle wind rising from the north, its ample folds were extended to the breeze in a most graceful and beautiful manner, eliciting one universal outburst of applause from the assembled multitude, which was kept up for some time, as the flag continued waving its folds, extending in the direction of the South, as if offering to ensure protection to the advocates and upholders of the government and principles of which it was emblematical in that section of the country. This happy incident had the effect of eliciting the following appropriate remarks from the President:---</p>
<p>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN---I had not thought to say a word, but it has occurred to me that a few weeks ago the ``Stars and Stripes'' hung rather languidly about the staff all over the nation. So, too, with this flag, when it was elevated to its place. At first it hung rather languidly, but the glorious breeze came, and it now floats as it should. (Cries of ``Good,'' and applause) And we hope that the same breeze is swelling the glorious flag throughout the whole nation.</p>

Elmer E. Ellsworth: May 25. 1861</div>
<p>My dear Sir and Madam, In the untimely loss of your noble son, our affliction here, is scarcely less than your own. So much of promised usefulness to one's country, and of bright hopes for one's self and friends, have rarely been so suddenly dashed, as in his fall. In size, in years, and in youthful appearance, a boy only, his power to command men, was surpassingly great. This power, combined with a fine intellect, an indomitable energy, and a taste altogether military, constituted in him, as seemed to me, the best natural talent, in that department, I ever knew. And yet he was singularly modest and deferential in social intercourse. My acquaintance with him began less than two years ago; yet through the latter half of the intervening period, it was as intimate as the disparity of our ages, and my engrossing engagements, would permit. To me, he appeared to have no indulgences or pastimes; and I never heard him utter a profane, or an intemperate word. What was conclusive of his good heart, he never forgot his parents. The honors he labored<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;386</span>
for so laudably, and, in the sad end, so gallantly gave his life, he meant for them, no less than for himself.</p>
<p>In the hope that it may be no intrusion upon the sacredness of your sorrow, I have ventured to address you this tribute to the memory of my young friend, and your brave and early fallen child.</p>
<p>May God give you that consolation which is beyond all earthly power. Sincerely your friend in a common affliction---</p>

<p>Sir: The President observes with concern that, notwithstanding the pledge of the State authorities to cooperate in preserving peace in Missouri, loyal citizens in great numbers continue to be driven from their homes. It is immaterial whether these outrages continue from inability or indisposition on the part of the State authorities to prevent them. It is enough that they continue to devolve on you the duty of putting a stop to them summarily by the force under your command, to be aided by such troops as you may require from Kansas, Iowa, and Illinois. The professions of loyalty to the Union by the State authorities of Missouri are not to be relied upon. They have already falsified their professions too often, and are too far committed to secession to be entitled to your confidence, and you can only be sure of their desisting from their wicked purposes when it is out of their power to prosecute them. You will therefore be unceasingly watchful of their movements, and not permit the clamors of their partizans and opponents of the wise measures already taken to prevent you from checking every movement against the government, however disguised under the pretended State authority. The authority of the United States is paramount, and whenever it is apparent that a movement, whether by color of State authority or not, is hostile, you will not hesitate to put it down.</p>

The result of Reverdy Johnson's conference with Bates is not indicated in any immediate communication from Bates, but on July 5, 1861, the attorney general returned a twenty-six-page opinion, the gist of which was that if suspension was understood to mean `` . . . a repeal of all power to issue the writ . . . none but Congress can do it.

<p>My dear Sir Doubtless you begin to understand how disagreeable it is to me to do a thing arbitrarily, when it is unsatisfactory to others associated with me.</p>
<p>I very much wish to appoint Col. Meigs Quarter-Master General, and yet Gen. Cameron does not quite consent. I have come to know Col.

<p>I know he has great confidence in you, always sustaining so far as I have observed, your opinions, against any differing ones.</p>
<p>You will lay me under one more obligation, if you can and will use your influence to remove Gen. Cameron's objection. I scarcely need tell you I have nothing personal in this, having never seen or heard of Col. Meigs, until about the end of last March. Your obt. Servt, A. LINCOLN</p>

And whereas the said Railroad Company is not able to pay said sum of money within time, according to said treaty; and whereas the President is of opinion that it is not for the interest of either party that said object of the treaty shall fail;<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;401</span>

<p>It is directed by the President that said Railroad Company, may execute their Bonds, with interest-warrants, or coupons attached, according to the forms hereto annexed, the principal of which Bonds shall amount to the aggregate sum of $286,742.15 and deposite the same with Archibald Williams of Kansas, hereby appointed to receive and receipt for the same, to be by him transmitted to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for the use of said Indians; and also shall, in due and proper form, execute, a mortgage upon one hundred thousand acres of the land contemplated in, and by said treaty, to aid in the construction of said Railroad, the said one hundred thousand acres to be the lands designated in the letter of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior, dated May 29th. 1861.</p>
<p>Said mortgage to be conditioned for the full payment of said Bonds, both as to interest and principal, and that on any failure to pay either when due, all right and interest of said Railroad Company in and to said mortgaged land, and also to all such of said land not mortgaged, as shall not at that time, be earned and patented, according to said treaty, shall be forfeited, and said land again become the absolute property of the United States in trust for said Indians; and said mortgaged lands to be in no event patented to said until said Bonds, principal and interest shall be fully paid. And upon said Bonds being so made and deposited, and said mortgage being so executed, and duly recorded in Leavenworth county, Kansas, all matters, so far as not necessarily varied by this arrangement, shall proceed in conformity to said treaty, as if the money had been paid by said Railroad Company, and had been invested by the President in said Railroad Bonds. Provided always that this arrangement shall be of no effect, until Archibald Williams, Judge of the United States Court for the District of Kansas, shall have indorsed a certificate upon this paper, that he has carefully examined the same, and also the Bonds and mortgage offered in compliance with its provis[ions], and has found that Bonds, and mortgage do in fact, comply with, and fulfil said provisions; and also that he has had before him, the chiefs and head men named in said treaty, as John Connor, Sax-cox-ie, Ne-con-he-con, and Rock-a-to-wha, and has fully explained to them the nature and<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;402</span>

Comr. of Ind. Affrs. June [c. 11], 1861</div>
<p>My dear Sir Some time ago I directed you to designate a suitable person to be Superintendent of Indian Affairs in Washington Territory, saying I would appoint the person you would so designate. You designated Anson Dart; and I now have the following reasons for not appointing him all coming to my knowledge since I gave you the direction mentioned.</p>
<p>1st. A member of the present Cabinet tells me that during Genl. Taylor's administration Dart distinctly tendered money to him for his influence to get an office from Gen. Taylor.</p>
<p>2nd. A member of the present H.R. from Wisconsin writes me over his own name that Dart is an immoral and dishonest man; and that if nominated, he will go before the Senate and procure his rejection if possible.</p>
<p>3rd. One of the Senators from Oregon tells me that Dart's character is very bad in that county; that he is universally understood out there to have left his family at home, and kept a prostitute while there; and that, if nominated, he will, in the Senate, procure his rejection if possible.</p>
<p>4th. The other Senator from Oregon tells me Dart's character is very odious and bad in that county; and that Dart, last winter, distinctly proposed to him that if he would procure his appointment<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;404</span>
to the Oregon Indian Superintendency, he would give him a thousand dollars the day the appointment should be made, and five hundred a year, as long as he should hold the office.</p>
<p>I presume you knew nothing of these things; and that neither you or I could knowingly be for such a man. Yours truly</p>
<p>A. LINCOLN</p>

A right result will be worth more to the world than ten times the men, and ten times the money.

The departments here have had more trouble to avoid receiving troops faster than they could provide them than from any other cause.

ago,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_422_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_422_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> the functions of the Federal Government were found to be generally<span class="ptr"><a name="4_422_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_422_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[4]</a></span> suspended within the several States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Florida, excepting only those of the Post Office Department.</p>
<p>Within these States, all the Forts, Arsenals, Dock-yards, Customhouses, and the like, including the movable and stationary property in, and about them, had been seized, and were held in open hostility to this Government, excepting only Forts Pickens, Taylor, and Jefferson, on, and near the Florida coast, and Fort Sumter, in Charleston harbor, South Carolina. The Forts thus seized had been put in improved condition; new ones had been built; and armed forces had been organized, and were organizing, all avowedly with the same hostile purpose.</p>
<p>The Forts remaining in the possession of the Federal government, in, and near, these States, were either<span class="ptr"><a name="4_422_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_422_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[5]</a></span> besieged or menaced by warlike preparations; and especially Fort Sumter was nearly surrounded by well-protected hostile batteries, with guns equal in quality to the best of its own, and outnumbering the latter as perhaps ten<span class="ptr"><a name="4_422_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_422_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[6]</a></span> to one. A disproportionate share,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_422_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_422_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[7]</a></span>of the Federal muskets and rifles,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_422_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_422_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[8]</a></span> had somehow found their way into these States, and had been seized, to be used against the government. Accumulations of the public revenue, lying within them,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_422_7"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_422_7;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[9]</a></span> had been seized for the same object. The Navy was scattered<span class="ptr"><a name="4_422_8"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_422_8;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[10]</a></span> in distant seas; leaving but a very small part of it within the immediate reach of the government. Officers<span class="ptr"><a name="4_422_9"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_422_9;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[11]</a></span> of the Federal Army and Navy, had resigned in great numbers; and, of those resigning, a and large proportion had taken up arms against the government. Simultaneously, and in connection, with all this, the purpose to sever the Federal Union, was openly avowed. In accordance with this purpose, an ordinance<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;423</span>
had been adopted in each of these States, declaring the States, respectively, to be separated from the National Union. A<span class="ptr"><a name="4_423_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_423_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[12]</a></span> formula for instituting a combined government of these states had been promulgated; and this illegal organization, in the character of confederate States was already invoking recognition, aid, and intervention, from Foreign Powers.</p>
<p>Finding this condition of things, and believing it to be an imperative duty upon the incoming Executive, to prevent, if possible, the consummation of such attempt to destroy the Federal Union, a choice of means to that end became indispensable. This choice was made; and was declared in the Inaugural address. The policy chosen looked to the exhaustion of all peaceful measures, before a resort to any stronger ones. It sought only to hold the public places and property, not already wrested from the Government, and to collect the revenue; relying for the rest, on time, discussion, and the ballot-box. It promised a continuance of the mails, at government expense, to the very people who were resisting the government; and it gave repeated pledges against any disturbance to any of the people, or any of their rights. Of all that which a president might constitutionally, and justifiably, do in such a case, everything was foreborne, without which, it was believed possible to keep the government on foot.</p>
<p>On the 5th of March, (the present incumbent's first full day in office) a letter of Major Anderson, commanding at Fort Sumter, written on the 28th of February, and received at the War Department on the 4th of March, was, by that Department, placed in his hands. This letter expressed the professional opinion of the writer, that re-inforcements could not be thrown into that Fort within the time for his relief, rendered necessary by the limited supply of provisions, and with a view of holding possession of the same, with a force of less than twenty thousand good, and well-disciplined men. This opinion was concurred in by all the officers of his command; and their <span class="rend-i">memoranda</span> on the subject, were made enclosures of Major Anderson's letter. The whole was immediately laid before Lieutenant General Scott, who at once concurred with Major Anderson in opinion. On reflection,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_423_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_423_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[13]</a></span> however, he took full<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;424</span>
time, consulting with other officers, both of the Army and the Navy; and, at the end of four days, came reluctantly, but decidedly, to the same conclusion as before. He also stated<span class="ptr"><a name="4_424_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_424_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[14]</a></span> at the same time that no such sufficient force was then at the control of the Government, or could be raised, and brought to the ground, within the time when the provisions in the Fort would be exhausted. In a purely military point of view, this reduced the duty of the administration, in the case, to the mere matter of getting the garrison safely out of the Fort.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_424_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_424_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[15]</a></span></p>
<p>It was<span class="ptr"><a name="4_424_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_424_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[16]</a></span> believed, however, that to so abandon that position, under the circumstances,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_424_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_424_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[17]</a></span> would be utterly ruinous; that the <span class="rend-i">necessity</span> under which it was to be done, would not be fully understood---that, by many, it would be construed as a part of a <span class="rend-i">voluntary</span> policy---that, at home, it would discourage the friends of the Union, embolden its adversaries, and go far to insure to the latter, a recognition<span class="ptr"><a name="4_424_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_424_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[18]</a></span> abroad---that, in fact, it would be our national destruction consummated. This could not be allowed.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_424_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_424_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[19]</a></span> Starvation was not yet upon the garrison; and ere it would be reached, <span class="rend-i">Fort Pickens</span> might be reinforced. This last, would be a clear indication of <span class="rend-i">policy</span>, and would better enable the country to accept the evacuation of Fort Sumter, as a military <span class="rend-i">necessity</span>. An order was at once directed to be sent for the landing of the troops from the Steamship Brooklyn, into Fort Pickens. This order could not go by land, but must take the longer, and slower route by sea. The first return news from the order was received just one week before the fall of Fort Sumter. The news itself was, that the officer commanding the Sabine, to which vessel the troops had been transferred from the Brooklyn, acting upon some <span class="rend-i">quasi</span> armistice of the late administration, (and<span class="ptr"><a name="4_424_7"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_424_7;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[20]</a></span> of the existence of which, the present administration, up to the time the order was despatched, had only too vague and uncertain rumors, to fix attention) had refused to land the troops. To now re-inforce Fort Pickens, before a crisis would be<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;425</span>
reached at Fort Sumter was impossible---rendered so by the near exhaustion of provisions in the latter-named Fort. In precaution against such a conjuncture, the government had, a few days before, commenced preparing an expedition, as well adapted as might be, to relieve Fort Sumter, which expedition was intended to be ultimately used, or not, according to circumstances. The strongest anticipated case, for using it, was now presented; and it was resolved to send it forward. As had been intended, in this contingency, it was also resolved to notify the Governor of South Carolina, that he might except an attempt would be made to provision the Fort; and that, if the attempt should not be resisted, there would be no effort to throw in men, arms, or ammunition, without further notice, or in case of an attack upon the Fort. This notice was accordingly given; whereupon the Fort was attacked, and bombarded to its fall, without even awaiting the arrival of the provisioning expedition.</p>
<p>It is thus seen that the assault upon, and reduction of, Fort Sumter, was, in no sense, a matter of self defence on the part of the assailants. They well knew that the garrison in the Fort could, by no possibility, commit aggression upon them. They knew---they were expressly notified---that the giving of bread to the few brave and hungry<span class="ptr"><a name="4_425_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_425_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[21]</a></span> men of the garrison, was all which would on that occasion<span class="ptr"><a name="4_425_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_425_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[22]</a></span> be attempted, unless themselves, by resisting so much, should provoke more. They knew that this Government desired to keep the garrison in the Fort, not to assail<span class="ptr"><a name="4_425_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_425_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[23]</a></span> them, but merely to maintain visible possession, and thus to preserve the Union from actual, and immediate dissolution---trusting, as herein-before stated, to time, discussion, and the ballot-box, for final adjustment; and they assailed, and reduced the Fort, for precisely the reverse object---to drive out the visible authority of the Federal Union, and thus force it to immediate dissolution.</p>
<p>That this was their object, the Executive well understood; and having said to them in the inaugural address, ``You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors,'' he took pains, not only to keep this declaration good, but also to keep the case so free from the power of ingenious sophistry,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_425_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_425_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[24]</a></span> as that the world should not be able to misunderstand it. By the affair at Fort Sumter, with its surrounding circumstances, that point was reached. Then, and thereby, the assailants of the Government, began the conflict of<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;426</span>
arms, without a gun in sight, or in expectancy, to return their fire, save only the few in the Fort, sent to that harbor, years before, for their own protection, and still ready to give that protection, in whatever was lawful. In this act, discarding all else, they have forced upon the country, the distinct issue: ``Immediate dissolution, or blood.''</p>
<p>And this issue embraces more than the fate of these United States. It presents to the whole family of man, the question, whether a constitutional<span class="ptr"><a name="4_426_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_426_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[25]</a></span> republic, or a democracy---a government of the people, by the same people---can, or cannot, maintain its territorial integrity, against its own domestic foes. It presents the question, whether discontented individuals, too few in numbers to control administration, according to organic law, in any case, can always, upon the pretences made in this case, or on any other pretences, or arbitrarily, without any pretence, break up their Government, and thus practically put an end to free government upon the earth. It forces us to ask: ``Is there, in all republics, this inherent, and fatal weakness?'' ``Must a government, of necessity, be too <span class="rend-i">strong</span> for the liberties of its own people, or too <span class="rend-i">weak</span> to maintain its own existence?''</p>
<p>So viewing the issue, no choice was left<span class="ptr"><a name="4_426_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_426_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[26]</a></span> but to call out the war power<span class="ptr"><a name="4_426_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_426_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[27]</a></span> of the Government; and so to resist force, employed for its destruction, by force, for its preservation.</p>
<p>The call was made; and the response of the country was most gratifying;<span class="ptr"><a name="4_426_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_426_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[28]</a></span> surpassing, in unanimity and spirit, the most sanguine expectation. Yet none of the States commonly called Slavestates, except Delaware,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_426_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_426_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[29]</a></span> gave a Regiment through regular State organization. A few regiments have been organized within some others<span class="ptr"><a name="4_426_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_426_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[30]</a></span> of those states, by individual enterprise, and received into the government<span class="ptr"><a name="4_426_7"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_426_7;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[31]</a></span> service. Of course the seceded States, so called, (and to which Texas had been joined about the time of the inauguration,) gave no troops to the cause of the Union. The border States, so called, were not uniform in their actions; some of them being almost <span class="rend-i">for</span> the Union, while in<span class="ptr"><a name="4_426_8"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_426_8;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[32]</a></span> others---as Virginia, North</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;427</span>Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas---the<span class="ptr"><a name="4_427_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_427_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[33]</a></span> Union sentiment was nearly repressed, and silenced. The course taken in Virginia was the most remarkable---perhaps the most important. A convention, elected by the people of that State, to consider this very question of disrupting the Federal Union, was in session at the capital of Virginia when Fort Sumter fell. To this body the people had chosen a large majority of <span class="rend-i">professed</span> Union men. Almost immediately after the fall of Sumter, many<span class="ptr"><a name="4_427_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_427_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[34]</a></span> members of that majority went over to the original disunion minority, and, with them, adopted an ordinance for withdrawing the State from the Union. Whether this change was wrought by their great approval of the assault upon Sumter, or their great resentment at the government's resistance to that assault, is not definitely known. Although<span class="ptr"><a name="4_427_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_427_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[35]</a></span> they submitted the ordinance, for ratification, to vote of the people, to be taken on a day then<span class="ptr"><a name="4_427_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_427_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[36]</a></span> somewhat more than a month distant,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_427_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_427_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[37]</a></span> the convention, and the Legislature, (Which was also in session at the same time and place) with leading men of the State, not members of either, immediately commenced acting, as if the State were<span class="ptr"><a name="4_427_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_427_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[38]</a></span> already out of the Union. They pushed military preparations vigorously forward all over the state. They seized the United States Armory at Harper's Ferry, and the Navy-yard at Gosport, near Norfolk. They received---perhaps invited---into their state, large bodies of troops, with their warlike appointments, from the so-called seceded<span class="ptr"><a name="4_427_7"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_427_7;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[39]</a></span> States. They formally entered into a treaty of temporary alliance, and co-operation with the so-called ``Confederate States,''<span class="ptr"><a name="4_427_8"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_427_8;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[40]</a></span> and sent members to their Congress at Montgomery. And, finally, they permitted the insurrectionary government to be transferred to their capital at Richmond.</p>
<p>The people of Virginia have thus allowed this giant insurrection to make its nest within her borders; and this government has no choice left but to deal with it, <span class="rend-i">where</span> it finds it. And it has the less regret, as the loyal citizens have, in due form, claimed its protection.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;428</span>Those loyal<span class="ptr"><a name="4_428_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_428_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[41]</a></span> citizens, this government is bound to recognize, and protect, as being Virginia.</p>
<p>In<span class="ptr"><a name="4_428_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_428_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[42]</a></span> the border States, so called---in fact, the middle states---there are those who favor a policy which they call ``armed neutrality''---that is, an arming of those states to prevent the Union forces passing one way, or the disunion, the other, over their soil. This would be disunion completed.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_428_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_428_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[43]</a></span> Figuratively speaking, it would be the building of an impassable wall along the line of separation. And yet, not quite an impassable one; for, under the guise of neutrality, it would tie the hands of the Union men, and freely pass supplies from among them, to the insurrectionists, which it could not do as an open enemy. At a stroke, it would take all the trouble off the hands of secession, except only what proceeds from the external blockade. It would do for the disunionists that which, of all things, they most desire---feed them well, and give them disunion without a struggle of their own. It recognizes no fidelity to the Constitution, no obligation to maintain the Union; and while<span class="ptr"><a name="4_428_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_428_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[44]</a></span> very many who have favored it are, doubtless, loyal citizens, it is, nevertheless, treason in effect.</p>
<p>Recurring to the action of the government, it may be stated that, at first, a call was made for seventy-five thousand militia; and rapidly following this, a proclamation was issued for closing the ports of the insurrectionary districts by proceedings in the nature of Blockade. So far all was believed to be strictly legal. At this point the insurrectionists announced their purpose to enter upon the practice of privateering.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_428_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_428_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[45]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;429</span>Other calls were made for volunteers,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_429_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_429_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[46]</a></span> to serve three years, unless sooner discharged; and also for large additions to the regular Army and Navy. These measures, whether strictly legal or not, were ventured upon, under what appeared to be a popular demand, and a public necessity; trusting, then as now, that Congress would readily ratify them. It is believed that nothing has been done beyond the constitutional competency of Congress.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_429_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_429_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[47]</a></span></p>
<p>Soon after the first call for militia, it<span class="ptr"><a name="4_429_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_429_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[48]</a></span> was considered a duty to authorize the Commanding General, in proper cases, according to his discretion, to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus; or, in other words, to arrest, and detain, without resort to the ordinary processes and forms of law, such individuals as he might deem dangerous to the public safety. This<span class="ptr"><a name="4_429_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_429_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[49]</a></span> authority has purposely been exercised but very sparingly. Nevertheless, the legality and propriety of what has been done under it, are questioned; and<span class="ptr"><a name="4_429_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_429_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[50]</a></span> the attention of the country has been called to the proposition<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;430</span>
that one who is sworn to ``take care that the laws be faithfully executed,'' should not himself violate them. Of course some consideration was given to the questions of power, and propriety, before this matter was acted upon. The whole of the laws which were required to be faithfully executed, were being resisted, and failing of execution, in nearly one-third of the States. Must they be allowed to finally fail of execution, even had it been perfectly clear, that by the use of the means necessary to their execution, some single law, made in such extreme tenderness of the citizen's liberty, that<span class="ptr"><a name="4_430_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_430_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[51]</a></span> practically, it relieves more of the guilty, than of the innocent, should, to a very limited extent, be violated? To state the question more directly, are all the laws, <span class="rend-i">but one</span>, to go unexecuted, and the government itself go to pieces, lest that one be violated?<span class="ptr"><a name="4_430_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_430_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[52]</a></span> Even<span class="ptr"><a name="4_430_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_430_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[53]</a></span> in such a case, would not the official oath be broken, if the government should be overthrown, when it was believed that disregarding the single law, would tend to preserve it? But it was not believed that this question was presented. It was not believed that any law was violated. The provision of the Constitution that ``The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, shall not be suspended unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it,'' is equivalent to a provision---is a provision---that such privilege may be suspended when, in cases of rebellion, or invasion, the public safety <span class="rend-i">does</span> require it. It<span class="ptr"><a name="4_430_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_430_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[54]</a></span> was decided that we have a case of rebellion, and that the public safety does require the qualified suspension of the privilege of the writ<span class="ptr"><a name="4_430_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_430_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[55]</a></span> which was<span class="ptr"><a name="4_430_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_430_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[56]</a></span> authorized to be made. Now it is insisted that Congress, and not the Executive, is vested with this power. But the Constitution itself, is silent as to which, or who, is to exercise the power; and as<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;431</span>
the provision was<span class="ptr"><a name="4_431_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_431_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[57]</a></span> plainly made for a dangerous emergency, it<span class="ptr"><a name="4_431_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_431_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[58]</a></span> cannot be believed<span class="ptr"><a name="4_431_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_431_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[59]</a></span> the framers of the instrument intended, that in every case, the danger should run its course, until Congress could be called together; the very assembling of which might be prevented, as was intended in this case, by the rebellion.</p>
<p>No<span class="ptr"><a name="4_431_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_431_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[60]</a></span> more extended argument is now offered; as an opinion, at some length, will probably be presented by the Attorney General. Whether there shall be any legislation upon the subject, and if any, what, is<span class="ptr"><a name="4_431_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_431_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[61]</a></span> submitted entirely to the better judgment of Congress.</p>
<p>The forbearance of this government had been so extraordinary, and so long continued, as to lead some foreign nations to shape their action as if they supposed the early destruction of our national Union was probable. While this, on discovery, gave the Executive some concern, he is now happy to say<span class="ptr"><a name="4_431_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_431_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[62]</a></span> that the sovereignty, and rights of the United States, are now everywhere practically respected by foreign powers; and a general sympathy with the country is manifested throughout the world.</p>
<p>The reports of the Secretaries of the Treasury, War, and the Navy, will give the information in detail deemed necessary, and convenient for your deliberation, and action; while the Executive, and all the Departments, will stand ready to supply omissions, or to communicate new facts, considered important for you to know.</p>
<p>It<span class="ptr"><a name="4_431_7"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_431_7;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[63]</a></span> is now recommended that you give the legal means for making this contest a short, and a decisive one; that you<span class="ptr"><a name="4_431_8"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_431_8;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[64]</a></span> place at the control of the government, for the work, at least four hundred<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;432</span>
thousand men, and four hundred millions of dollars. That number of men is about one tenth<span class="ptr"><a name="4_432_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_432_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[65]</a></span> of those of proper ages within the regions where, apparently,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_432_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_432_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[66]</a></span><span class="rend-i">all</span> are willing to engage; and the sum is less than a twentythird<span class="ptr"><a name="4_432_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_432_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[67]</a></span> part of the money value owned by the men who seem<span class="ptr"><a name="4_432_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_432_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[68]</a></span> ready to devote the whole. A debt of six hundred millions of dollars <span class="rend-i">now</span>, is a less sum per head, than was the debt of our revolution, when we came out of that struggle; and the money value in the country now, bears even a greater proportion to what it was <span class="rend-i">then</span>, than does the population. Surely each man has as strong a motive <span class="rend-i">now</span>, to <span class="rend-i">preserve</span> our liberties, as each had <span class="rend-i">then</span>, to <span class="rend-i">establish</span> them.</p>
<p>A right result, at this time, will be worth more to the world, than ten times the men, and ten times the money.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_432_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_432_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[69]</a></span> The evidence reaching us from the country, leaves no doubt, that the material for the work is abundant; and that it needs only the hand of legislation to give it legal sanction, and the hand of the Executive to give it practical shape and efficiency. One<span class="ptr"><a name="4_432_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_432_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[70]</a></span> of the greatest perplexities of the government, is to avoid receiving troops faster than it can provide for them. In a word, the people will save their government, if the government itself, will do its part, only indifferently well.</p>
<p>It might seem, at first thought, to be of<span class="ptr"><a name="4_432_7"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_432_7;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[71]</a></span> little difference whether the present movement at the South be called ``secession'' or ``rebellion.'' The movers, however, well understand the difference. At the beginning, they knew they could never raise their treason to any respectable magnitude, by any name which implies <span class="rend-i">violation</span> of law. They knew their people possessed as much of moral sense, as much of devotion to law and order, and as much pride in, and reverence for, the history, and government, of their common country, as any other civilized, and patriotic people. They knew they could make no advancement directly in the teeth of these strong and noble sentiments. Accordingly they commenced by an<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;433</span>
insidious debauching of the public mind.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_433_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_433_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[72]</a></span> They invented an<span class="ptr"><a name="4_433_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_433_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[73]</a></span> ingenious sophism, which, if conceded, was followed by perfectly logical steps, through all the incidents, to the complete destruction of the Union. The sophism itself<span class="ptr"><a name="4_433_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_433_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[74]</a></span> is, that any state of the Union may, <span class="rend-i">consistently</span> with the national Constitution, and therefore <span class="rend-i">lawfully</span>, and <span class="rend-i">peacefully</span>, withdraw from the Union, without the consent of the Union, or of any other state. The little disguise that the supposed right is to be exercised only for just cause, themselves to be the<span class="ptr"><a name="4_433_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_433_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[75]</a></span> sole judge of its justice, is too thin to merit any notice.</p>
<p>With rebellion thus sugar-coated, they have been drugging the public mind of their section for more than thirty years; and, until at length, they have brought many good men to a willingness to take up arms against the government the day <span class="rend-i">after</span> some assemblage of men have enacted the farcical pretence of taking their State out of the Union, who could have been brought to no such thing the day <span class="rend-i">before</span>.</p>
<p>This sophism derives much---perhaps the whole---of its currency, from the assumption, that there is some omnipotent, and sacred supremacy, pertaining to a <span class="rend-i">State</span>---to each State of our Federal Union. Our States have neither more, nor less power, than that reserved to them, in the Union, by the Constitution---no one of them ever having been a State <span class="rend-i">out</span> of the Union. The original ones passed into the Union even <span class="rend-i">before</span> they cast off their British colonial dependence; and the new ones each came into the Union directly from a condition of dependence, excepting Texas. And even Texas, in its temporary independence, was never designated a State. The new ones only took the designation of States, on coming into the Union, while that name was first adopted for the old ones, in, and by, the Declaration of Independence. Therein the ``United Colonies'' were declared to be ``Free and Independent States''; but, even then, the object plainly was not to declare their independence of <span class="rend-i">one another</span>, or of the <span class="rend-i">Union;</span> but directly the contrary, as their mutual pledge, and their mutual action, before, at the time,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_433_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_433_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[76]</a></span> and afterwards, abundantly show. The express plighting of faith, by each and all of the original thirteen, in the Articles of Confederation, two years later, that the Union shall<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;434</span>
be perpetual, is most conclusive. Having never been States, either in substance, or in name, <span class="rend-i">outside</span> of the Union, whence this magical omnipotence of ``State rights,'' asserting a claim of power<span class="ptr"><a name="4_434_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_434_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[77]</a></span> to lawfully destroy the Union itself? Much is said about the ``sovereignty'' of the States; but the word, even, is not in the national Constitution; nor, as is<span class="ptr"><a name="4_434_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_434_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[78]</a></span> believed, in any of the State constitutions. What<span class="ptr"><a name="4_434_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_434_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[79]</a></span> is a ``sovereignty,'' in the political sense of the term? Would it be far wrong to define it ``A political community, without a political superior''? Tested by this, no one of our States, except Texas, ever was a sovereignty. And even Texas gave up the character on coming into the Union; by which act, she acknowledged the Constitution of the United States, and the laws and treaties of the United States made in pursuance of the Constitution, to be, for her, the supreme law of the land. The States have their <span class="rend-i">status</span> IN the Union, and they have no other <span class="rend-i">legal status</span>. If they break from this, they<span class="ptr"><a name="4_434_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_434_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[80]</a></span> can only do so against law, and by revolution. The<span class="ptr"><a name="4_434_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_434_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[81]</a></span> Union, and not themselves separately, procured their independence, and their liberty. By conquest, or purchase, the Union gave each of them, whatever of independence, and liberty, it has. The Union is older than any of the States; and, in fact, it created them as States.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_434_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_434_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[82]</a></span> Originally,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_434_7"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_434_7;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[83]</a></span> some dependent colonies<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;435</span>
made the Union; and, in turn, the Union threw off their old dependence, for them,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_435_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_435_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[84]</a></span> and made them States, such as they are. Not one of them ever had a State constitution, independent of the Union. Of course, it is not forgotten that all the new States framed their constitutions, before they entered the Union; nevertheless, dependent upon, and preparatory to, coming into the Union.</p>
<p>Unquestionably the States have the powers, and rights, reserved to them in, and by the National Constitution; but among these,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_435_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_435_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[85]</a></span> surely, are not included all conceivable powers, however mischievous, or destructive; but, at most, such only, as were known in the world, at the time, as governmental powers; and certainly, a power to destroy the government itself, had never been known as a governmental---as a merely administrative power. This relative matter of National power, and State rights, as a principle, is no other than the principle of <span class="rend-i">generality</span>, and <span class="rend-i">locality</span>. Whatever concerns the whole, should be confided to the whole---to the general government; while, whatever concerns <span class="rend-i">only</span> the State, should be left exclusively, to the State. This is all there is of original principle about it. Whether the National Constitution, in defining boundaries between the two, has applied the principle with exact accuracy, is not to be questioned. We are all bound by that defining, without question.</p>
<p>What<span class="ptr"><a name="4_435_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_435_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[86]</a></span> is now combatted, is the position that secession is <span class="rend-i">consistent</span> with the Constitution---is <span class="rend-i">lawful</span>, and <span class="rend-i">peaceful</span>. It is not contended that there is any express law for it; and nothing should ever be implied as law, which leads to unjust, or absurd consequences. The nation purchased, with money, the countries out of which several of these States were formed. Is it just that they shall go off without leave, and without refunding? The nation paid very large sums, (in the aggregate, I believe, nearly a hundred millions) to relieve Florida of the aboriginal tribes. Is it just that she shall now be off without consent, or without making any return? The nation is now in debt for money applied to the benefit of these so-called seceding States, in common with the rest. Is it just, either that<span class="ptr"><a name="4_435_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_435_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[87]</a></span> creditors shall go unpaid, or the remaining States pay the<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;436</span>
whole? A part of the present national debt was contracted to pay the old debts of Texas. Is it just that she shall leave, and pay no part of this herself?</p>
<p>Again, if one State may secede, so may another; and when all shall have seceded, none is left to pay the debts. Is this quite just to creditors? Did we notify them of this sage view of ours, when we borrowed their money? If we now recognize this doctrine, by allowing the seceders to go in peace, it is difficult to see what we can<span class="ptr"><a name="4_436_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_436_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[88]</a></span> do, if others choose to go, or to extort terms upon which they will promise to remain.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_436_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_436_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[89]</a></span></p>
<p>The seceders insist that our Constitution admits of secession. They have assumed to make a National Constitution of their own, in which,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_436_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_436_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[90]</a></span> of necessity, they have either <span class="rend-i">discarded</span>, or <span class="rend-i">retained</span>, the right of secession, as they insist, it exists in ours. If they have discarded it, they thereby admit that, on principle, it ought not to be in ours. If they have retained it, by their own construction of ours they show that<span class="ptr"><a name="4_436_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_436_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[91]</a></span> to be consistent they must secede from one another, whenever they shall find it the easiest way of settling their debts, or effecting any other selfish, or unjust object. The principle itself is one of disintegration, and upon which no government can possibly endure.</p>
<p>If all the States, save one, should assert the power to <span class="rend-i">drive</span> that one out of the Union, it is presumed the whole class of seceder politicians would at once deny the power, and denounce the act as the greatest outrage upon State rights. But suppose that precisely the same act, instead of being called ``driving the one out,'' should be called ``the seceding of the others from that one,'' it would be exactly what the seceders claim to do; unless, indeed,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_436_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_436_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[92]</a></span> they make the point, that the one, because it is a minority, may rightfully do, what the others, because they are a majority, may not rightfully do. These politicians are subtle, and profound, on the rights<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;437</span>
of minorities.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_437_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_437_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[93]</a></span> They<span class="ptr"><a name="4_437_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_437_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[94]</a></span> are not partial to that power which made the Constitution, and speaks from the preamble, calling itself ``We, the People.''</p>
<p>It may well be questioned whether there is, to-day, a majority of the legally qualified voters of any State, except perhaps<span class="ptr"><a name="4_437_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_437_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[95]</a></span> South Carolina, in favor of disunion. There is much reason to believe that<span class="ptr"><a name="4_437_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_437_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[96]</a></span> the Union men are the majority in many, if not in every other one, of the so-called seceded States. The contrary has not been demonstrated in any one of them. It is ventured to affirm<span class="ptr"><a name="4_437_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_437_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[97]</a></span> this, even of Virginia and Tennessee; for the result of an election, held in military camps, where the bayonets are all on one side of the question voted upon, can scarcely be considered as demonstrating<span class="ptr"><a name="4_437_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_437_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[98]</a></span> popular sentiment. At such an election, all that large class who are, at once, <span class="rend-i">for</span> the Union, and <span class="rend-i">against</span> coercion, would be coerced to vote against the Union.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_437_7"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_437_7;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[99]</a></span></p>
<p>It may be affirmed, without extravagance, that the free institutions we enjoy, have developed the powers, and improved the condition, of our whole people, beyond any example in the world. Of this we now have a striking, and an impressive illustration. So large an army as the government has now on foot, was never before known, without a soldier in it, but who had taken his place there, of his own free choice. But more than this: there are many single Regiments whose members, one and another, possess full practical knowledge of all the arts, sciences, professions, and whatever else, whether useful or elegant, is known in the world; and there is scarcely one, from which there could not be selected, a President, a Cabinet, a Congress, and perhaps a Court, abundantly competent to administer the government itself. Nor do I say<span class="ptr"><a name="4_437_8"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_437_8;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[100]</a></span> this is not true, also, in the army of our late friends, now adversaries, in this contest; but if it is, so much better the reason why<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;438</span>
the government, which has conferred such benefits on both them and us, should not be broken up. Whoever, in any section, proposes to abandon such a government, would do well to consider, in deference to what principle it is, that he does it---what better he is likely to get in its stead---whether the substitute will give, or be intended to give, so much of good to the people. There are some foreshadowings on this subject. Our adversaries have adopted some Declarations of Independence; in which, unlike the good old one, penned by Jefferson, they omit the words ``all men are created equal.'' Why? They have adopted a temporary national constitution, in the preamble of which, unlike our good old one, signed by Washington, they omit ``We, the People,'' and substitute ``We, the deputies of the sovereign and independent States.'' Why?<span class="ptr"><a name="4_438_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_438_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[101]</a></span> Why this deliberate pressing out of view, the rights of men, and the authority of the people?</p>
<p>This is essentially a People's contest. On the side of the Union, it is a struggle for maintaining in the world, that form, and substance of government, whose leading object is, to elevate the condition of men---to lift artificial weights from all shoulders---to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all---to afford all, an unfettered start, and a fair chance, in the race of life. Yielding to partial, and temporary departures, from necessity, this is the leading object of the government for whose existence we contend.</p>
<p>I am most happy to believe that the plain people understand, and appreciate this. It is worthy of note, that while in this, the government's hour of trial, large numbers of those in the Army and Navy, who have been favored with the offices, have resigned, and proved<span class="ptr"><a name="4_438_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_438_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[102]</a></span> false to the<span class="ptr"><a name="4_438_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_438_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[103]</a></span> hand which had pampered them, not one common soldier, or common sailor is<span class="ptr"><a name="4_438_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_438_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[104]</a></span> is known to have deserted his flag.</p>

<p>Our popular government has often been called an experiment. Two points in it, our people have already settled---the successful <span class="rend-i">establishing</span>, and the successful <span class="rend-i">administering</span> of it. One still remains---its<span class="ptr"><a name="4_439_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_439_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[108]</a></span> successful <span class="rend-i">maintenance</span><span class="ptr"><a name="4_439_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_439_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[109]</a></span> against a formidable [internal]<span class="ptr"><a name="4_439_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_439_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[110]</a></span> attempt to overthrow it. It is now for them to demonstrate to the world, that those who can fairly carry an election, can also suppress a rebellion<span class="ptr"><a name="4_439_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_439_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[111]</a></span>---that ballots are the rightful, and peaceful, successors of bullets; and that when ballots have fairly, and constitutionally, decided, there can be no successful appeal, back to bullets; that<span class="ptr"><a name="4_439_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_439_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[112]</a></span> there can be no successful appeal, except to ballots themselves, at succeeding elections. Such will be a great lesson of peace; teaching men that what they cannot take by an election, neither can they take it by a war---teaching all, the folly of being the beginners of a war.</p>
<p>Lest there be some uneasiness in the minds of candid men, as to what is to be the course of the government, towards the Southern States, <span class="rend-i">after</span> the rebellion shall have been suppressed, the Executive deems it proper to say, it will be his purpose then, as ever, to be guided by the Constitution, and the laws; and that he probably will have no different understanding of the powers, and duties of the Federal government, relatively<span class="ptr"><a name="4_439_7"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_439_7;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[113]</a></span> to the rights of the States, and the people, under the Constitution, than that expressed in the inaugural address.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_439_8"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_439_8;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[114]</a></span></p>
<p>He desires to preserve the government, that it may be administered for all, as it was administered by the men who made it. Loyal citizens everywhere, have the right to claim this of their government; and the government has no right to withhold, or neglect it. It is not perceived that, in giving it, there is any coercion,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;440</span>
any conquest, or any subjugation,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_440_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_440_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[115]</a></span> in any just sense of those terms.</p>
<p>The Constitution provides, and all the States have accepted the provision, that ``The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of government.'' But, if a State may lawfully go out of the Union, having done so, it may also discard the republican form of government; so that to prevent its going out, is an indispensable <span class="rend-i">means</span>, to the <span class="rend-i">end</span>, of maintaining the guaranty mentioned; and when an end is lawful and obligatory, the indispensable means to it, are also lawful, and obligatory.</p>
<p>It was with the deepest regret that the Executive found the duty of employing the war-power, in defence of the government, forced upon him. He could but perform this duty, or surrender the existence of the government. No<span class="ptr"><a name="4_440_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_440_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[116]</a></span> compromise, by public servants, could, in this case, be a cure; not that compromises are not often proper, but that no popular government can long survive a marked precedent, that those who carry an election, can only save the government from immediate destruction, by giving up the main point, upon which the people gave the election. The people themselves, and not their servants, can safely reverse their own deliberate decisions. As a private citizen, the Executive<span class="ptr"><a name="4_440_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_440_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[117]</a></span> could not have consented that these institutions shall perish; much less could he, in betrayal of so vast, and so sacred a trust, as these free people had confided to him. He felt that he had no moral right to shrink; nor even to count the chances of his own life, in what might follow. In full view of his great responsibility, he has, so far, done what he has deemed his duty. You will now, according to your own judgment, perform yours. He sincerely hopes that your views, and your action, may so accord with his, as to assure all faithful citizens, who have been disturbed in their rights, of a certain, and speedy restoration to them, under the Constitution, and the laws.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;441</span>And having thus chosen our course, without guile, and with pure purpose, let us renew our trust in God,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_441_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_441_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[118]</a></span> and go forward without fear, and with manly hearts.

<h3>Annotation</h3>
<a name="4_421_3"></a><div class="textindentlevelx" id="4_421_3">
<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; AD, first proof sheets with autograph revisions, second proof sheets, two copies, (1) with revisions by William H. Seward for the most part in the handwriting of Frederick W. Seward, (2) with Lincoln's final revisions, DLC-RTL. Although engrossed official copies of Lincoln's later Messages are in the National Archives, no official copy of the Message of July 4, 1861, has been found. The text reproduced here is that of the second proof containing Lincoln's final revisions, which, with the exception of minor changes in punctuation, are noted in the succeeding footnotes. Variants, emendations, and deletions made by Lincoln in the manuscript and on the first proof are also indicated in the footnotes. Minor inconsistencies in usage occurring in Lincoln's manuscript and autograph changes in the proof sheets have been made to conform with the printed proof, but Lincoln's paragraphing, punctuation and capitalization in the manuscript and autograph corrections have been retained in some cases even though not followed by the printers who set the proofs.</p>

Three additional sentences in Lincoln's autograph appear immediately following this sentence inserted at bottom of page ten of first proof, but were deleted in favor of the full paragraph autograph insertion (see note 42) at the same point. The deleted sentences are as follows: ``Suppose two respectable gentlemen, both of whom have sworn to support the constitution of the United States, shall each, at the same time, claim to be Governor of Virginia. Which of the two should this government recognize? Him who disregards, or him who keeps, his oath, in this respect?''</p>

<p>[44]&nbsp;&nbsp; ``While they may not all be traitors who have favored it, the thing is, in fact, treason in disguise,'' in the autograph insertion in first proof, changed by Seward to the reading adopted by Lincoln in the second proof, Lincoln adding the word ``doubtless'' to Seward's revision. ``Treason'' is amended to ``very injurious'' in the <span class="rend-i">Congressional Globe Appendix</span>, which is followed by Nicolay and Hay, suggesting further revision before release for publication.</p>
</div>
<a name="4_428_5"></a><div class="textindentlevelx" id="4_428_5">
<p>[45]&nbsp;&nbsp; Seward deleted, and Lincoln adopted in second proof, the sentence standing next in the manuscript and first proof, as follows: ``On more mature reflection, with observation on current events, it was [the administration] concluded that the measures adopted were inadequate to the occasion, both by reason of the very limited time the militia would be held to serve, and the general insufficiency of numbers in the regular land and naval forces.'' Lincoln had changed ``the administration concluded,'' appearing in the manuscript, to ``it was concluded'' in first proof.</p>
</div>
<a name="4_429_1"></a><div class="textindentlevelx" id="4_429_1">
<p>[46]&nbsp;&nbsp; ``Accordingly another call was made for---volunteers,'' in the manuscript and first proof, changed by Seward to the present reading adopted in the second proof.</p>
</div>
<a name="4_429_2"></a><div class="textindentlevelx" id="4_429_2">
<p>[47]&nbsp;&nbsp; Two short paragraphs as revised in the manuscript and first proof are deleted at this point in the second proof by Seward. Deletion adopted by Lincoln.</p>
<p>They are as follows:</p>
<p>``Whether the proceedings in the nature of blockade, be technically a blockade, scarcely needs to be considered; since foreign nations only claim what we concede, that, as between them and us, the strict law of blockade shall apply.</p>
<p>``The attention of Congress is sought in aid of this means for suppressing the insurrection, as the one affording at once, the greatest efficiency, and least danger to life, of any at the control of the government.''</p>
</div>
<a name="4_429_3"></a><div class="textindentlevelx" id="4_429_3">
<p>[48]&nbsp;&nbsp; ``I felt it my duty,'' in the manuscript, revised in first proof to ``it was considered a duty.''</p>
</div>
<a name="4_429_4"></a><div class="textindentlevelx" id="4_429_4">
<p>[49]&nbsp;&nbsp; ``At my verbal request, as well as by the Generals own inclination, this authority has been exercised,'' in the manuscript, revised in first proof to ``This authority has purposely been exercised.''</p>
</div>
<a name="4_429_5"></a><div class="textindentlevelx" id="4_429_5">
<p>[50]&nbsp;&nbsp; The remainder of this sentence, the next two sentences, and the beginning of the next, were revised in first proof to the present text. In the manuscript they are as follows: ``and I have been reminded from a high quarter that one who is sworn to `take care that the laws be faithfully executed' should not himself be one to violate them. [``So I think'' deleted in the manuscript.] Of course I gave some consideration to the questions of power, and propriety, before I acted in this matter. The whole of the laws which I was sworn to take care that they be faithfully executed, were being resisted, and failing to be executed, in nearly one third of the states. Must I have allowed them,'' etc.</p>
</div>
<a name="4_430_1"></a><div class="textindentlevelx" id="4_430_1">
<p>[51]&nbsp;&nbsp; In the manuscript the remainder of this sentence originally read that ``more rogues than honest men find shelter under it, should, to a very limited extent, be violated?'' This was first revised to read as follows: ``that practically more of the guilty than [of] the innocent, find shelter under it,'' etc. The second revision on the manuscript stands in the first proof and thereafter, except for the insertion ``of'' in first proof as indicated in brackets.</p>
</div>
<a name="4_430_2"></a><div class="textindentlevelx" id="4_430_2">
<p>[52]&nbsp;&nbsp; ``Violated,'' in the first proof, changed by Seward in the second proof to ``broken.'' Not adopted by Lincoln.</p>
</div>
<a name="4_430_3"></a><div class="textindentlevelx" id="4_430_3">
<p>[53]&nbsp;&nbsp; This and the next two sentences inserted in first proof in Lincoln's autograph revised three sentences in the manuscript which read as follows: ``Even in such a case I should consider my official oath broken if I should allow the government to be overthrown, when I might think the disregarding the single law would tend to preserve it. But, in this case I was not, in my own judgment, driven to this ground. In my opinion I violated no law.''</p>

<p>[62]&nbsp;&nbsp; The remainder of this sentence is inserted in second proof by Seward and adopted by Lincoln, with minor changes in punctuation, in place of the following in the manuscript and first proof: ``he finds no cause of complaint against the present course of any foreign power, upon this subject.''</p>

<p>[64]&nbsp;&nbsp; The remainder of this sentence is revised to its present text in the second proof from the following wording in the manuscript and first proof: ``that you authorize to be applied to the work at least --- hundred thousand men, and three hundred millions of dollars.'' Seward had inserted ``if necessary'' following ``work'' and ``4'' in the blank space. Lincoln adopted only the latter suggestion.</p>

<p>I transmit to Congress a copy of correspondence between the Secretary of State and Her Britannic Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary accredited to this Government, relative to an Exhibition of the products of Industry of all nations which is to take place at London in the course of next year. As citizens of the United States may justly pride themselves upon their proficiency in industrial arts, it is desirable that they should have proper facilities towards taking part in the Exhibition. With this view, I recommend such legislation by Congress at this session as may be necessary for that purpose. ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

The purported agreement was negotiated prior to Lincoln's inauguration and the secession of Florida, and was in fact merely a temporary verbal agreement and not a signed armistice. An order from Secretary Welles, sent by Lieutenant John L. Worden of the Navy, finally reached Adams, and Fort Pickens was reinforced on the night of April 12.

<p>And whereas, when our own beloved Country, once, by the blessing of God, united, prosperous and happy, is now afflicted with faction and civil war, it is peculiarly fit for us to recognize the hand of God in this terrible visitation, and in sorrowful remembrance of our own faults and crimes as a nation and as individuals, to humble ourselves before Him, and to pray for His mercy,---to pray that we may be spared further punishment, though most justly deserved; that our arms may be blessed and made effectual for the re-establishment of law, order and peace, throughout the wide extent of our country; and that the inestimable boon of civil and religious liberty, earned under His guidance and blessing, by the labors and sufferings of our fathers, may be restored in all its original excellence:---</p>
<p>Therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do appoint the last Thursday in September next, as a day of humiliation, prayer and fasting for all the people of the nation. And I do earnestly recommend to all the People, and especially to all ministers and teachers of religion of all denominations, and to all heads of families, to observe and keep that day according to their several creeds and modes of worship, in all humility and with all religious solemnity, to the end that the united prayer of the nation may ascend to the Throne of Grace and bring down plentiful blessings upon our Country.</p>

B. Magoffin August 24. 1861</div>
<p>Governor of the State of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Sir: Your letter of the 19th. Inst. in which you ``<span class="rend-i">urge the removal from the limits of Kentucky of the military force now organized, and in camp within said State</span>'' is received.</p>
<p>I may not possess full and precisely accurate knowledge upon this subject; but I believe it is true that there is a military force in camp within Kentucky, acting by authority of the United States, which force is not very large, and is not now being augmented.</p>
<p>I also believe that some arms have been furnished to this force by the United States.</p>
<p>I also believe this force consists exclusively of Kentuckians, having their camp in the immediate vicinity of their own homes, and not assailing, or menacing, any of the good people of Kentucky.</p>
<p>In all I have done in the premises, I have acted upon the urgent solicitation of many Kentuckians, and in accordance with what I believed, and still believe, to be the wish of a majority of all the Union-loving people of Kentucky.</p>
<p>While I have conversed on this subject with many eminent men of Kentucky, including a large majority of her Members of Congress, I do not remember that any one of them, or any other person, except your Excellency and the bearers of your Excellency's letter, has urged me to remove the military force from Kentucky, or to disband it. One other very worthy citizen of Kentucky did solicit me to have the augmenting of the force suspended for a time.</p>
<p>Taking all the means within my reach to form a judgment, I do not believe it is the popular wish of Kentucky that this force shall be removed beyond her limits; and, with this impression, I must respectfully decline to so remove it.</p>
<p>I most cordially sympathize with your Excellency, in the wish to preserve the peace of my own native State, Kentucky; but it is with regret I search, and can not find, in your not very short letter, any declaration, or intimation, that you entertain any desire for the preservation of the Federal Union. Your Obedient Servant,</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; AES, IHi. Lincoln's endorsement is written on the back of William W. Richmond to Lincoln, Washington, August 25, 1861, complaining of Lincoln's refusal to see him `` . . . upon the supposition that I was unworthy of that common courtesy: that you supposed I had unauthorisedly drawn money from the Treasury and that I had substituted myself for some one else!'' Richmond explained that he had acted in good faith, supposing himself legitimately appointed, but that he was not William B. Richmond. He also denied having listed Senator Simmons among his supporters. Unfortunately his letter addressed to Mrs. Lincoln August 8, 1861 (DLC-RTL), did list Senator Simmons among the references, and Lincoln's dubiety, when he was confronted by the senator's denial, is readily understood. In Richmond's letter to Mrs. Lincoln, Senator Simmons' name occurs among several others inserted after the letter was written, as names of persons whom Richmond had been told were supporting his application. Richmond explained to Lincoln in a letter of September 21, 1861, that the copy of the unfortunate letter retained by himself did not contain any of the names listed. As a result of the confusion, neither William B. Richmond nor William W. Richmond received the consulship at Paris, and William B. Richmond was further disappointed in failing of confirmation for the consulship at Tunis when Lincoln withdrew his nomination, March 24, 1862.

Major General Fremont: Washington D.C. Sept. 2, 1861.</div>

<p>Secondly,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_506_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_506_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> I think there is great danger that the closing paragraph, in relation to the confiscation of property, and the liberating slaves of traiterous owners, will alarm our Southern Union friends, and turn them against us---perhaps ruin our rather fair prospect for Kentucky. Allow me therefore to ask, that you will as of your own motion, modify that paragraph so as to conform to the <span class="rend-i">first</span> and <span class="rend-i">fourth</span> sections of the act of Congress, entitled, ``An act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes,'' approved August, 6th, 1861, and a copy of which act I herewith send you.

of the necessities of your position than I could at this distance, on seeing your proclamation of August 30th. I perceived no general objection to it. The particular clause, however, in relation to the confiscation of property and the liberation of slaves, appeared to me to be objectionable, in it's non-conformity to the Act of Congress passed the 6th. of last August upon the same subjects; and hence I wrote you expressing my wish that that clause should be modified accordingly. Your answer, just received, expresses the preference on your part, that I should make an open order for the modification, which I very cheerfully do. It is therefore ordered that the said clause of said proclamation be so modified, held, and construed, as to conform to, and not to transcend, the provisions on the same subject contained in the act of Congress entitled ``An Act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes'' Approved, August 6. 1861; and that said act be published at length with this order.

Across the bottom of the second page of the copy Lincoln wrote in parentheses, ``The Act referred to commences on page 80, of pamphlet acts of congress of late session.'' The act of August 6, 1861, section 4, reads as follows: ``Provided that any person held to service or labor, by laws of any State, to another, the owner of such claim to labor loses his claim if person held to labor is employed in hostile service against the government.''

The original has never reached me. Shall I act on that?'' (DLC-RTL).

Assuming him to be one of those Commissioners, the President understands Mr. Davis could at the time of his arrest, could at any time since, and can now, be released by taking a full oath of allegiance to the Government of the United States; and that Mr. Davis has not been kept in ignorance of this condition of release.

<p>The public safety renders it necessary that the grounds of these arrests should at present be withheld, but at the proper time they will be made public. Of one thing the people of Maryland may rest assured: that no arrest has been made, or will be made, not based on substantial and unmistakable complicity with those in armed rebellion against the Government of the United States. In no case has an arrest been made on mere suspicion, or through personal or partisan animosities, but in all cases the Government is in possession of tangible and unmistakable evidence, which will, when made public, be satisfactory to every loyal citizen.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; AES IHi. Lincoln's endorsement is written on the back of McClernand's letter of September 11, 1861, explaining more fully than his telegram of the same date (see Lincoln to Cameron, September 11, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>) his need as commanding officer at Cairo, Illinois, for a staff officer and asking again for the assignment of First Lieutenant James H. Wilson: `` . . . all this work I have done without a staff---without an adjutant, and even without an aid, for the commission of Capt. Bielaski has been revoked.'' A lengthy endorsement by Lieutenant Colonel Hartman Bache, Bureau of Topographical Engineers, September 18, explained that Lieutenant Wilson had been assigned to recruiting a company of enlisted men and that other generals (Dix, Anderson, and Samuel R. Curtis) were ahead of McClernand with requests for a staff officer from the Bureau.</p>

<span class="rend-i">Private &amp; confidential.</span><br>
Hon. O. H. Browning Executive Mansion Washington<br>
My dear Sir Sept 22d 1861.</div>
<p>Yours of the 17th is just received; and coming from you, I confess it astonishes me. That you should object to my adhering to a law, which you had assisted in making, and presenting to me, less than a month before, is odd enough. But this is a very small part. Genl. Fremont's proclamation, as to confiscation of property, and the liberation of slaves, is <span class="rend-i">purely political</span>, and not within the range of <span class="rend-i">military</span> law, or necessity. If a commanding General finds a necessity to seize the farm of a private owner, for a pasture, an encampment, or a fortification, he has the right to do so, and to so hold it, as long as the necessity lasts; and this is within military law, because within military necessity. But to say the farm shall no longer belong to the owner, or his heirs forever; and this as well when the farm is not needed for military purposes as when it is, is purely political, without the savor of military law about it. And the same is true of slaves. If the General needs them, he can seize them, and use them; but when the need is past, it is not for him to fix their permanent future condition. That must be settled according to laws made by law-makers, and not by military proclamations. The proclamation in the point in question, is simply ``dictatorship.'' It assumes that the general may do <span class="rend-i">anything</span> he pleases---confiscate the lands and free the slaves of <span class="rend-i">loyal</span> people, as well as of disloyal ones. And going the whole figure I have no<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;532</span>
doubt would be more popular with some thoughtless people, than that which has been done! But I cannot assume this reckless position; nor allow others to assume it on my responsibility. You speak of it as being the only means of <span class="rend-i">saving</span> the government. On the contrary it is itself the surrender of the government. Can it be pretended that it is any longer the government of the U.S.---any government of Constitution and laws,---wherein a General, or a President, may make permanent rules of property by proclamation?</p>
<p>I do not say Congress might not with propriety pass a law, on the point, just such as General Fremont proclaimed. I do not say I might not, as a member of Congress, vote for it. What I object to, is, that I as President, shall expressly or impliedly seize and exercise the permanent legislative functions of the government.</p>
<p>So much as to principle. Now as to policy. No doubt the thing was popular in some quarters, and would have been more so if it had been a general declaration of emancipation. The Kentucky Legislature would not budge till that proclamation was modified; and Gen. Anderson telegraphed me that on the news of Gen. Fremont having actually issued deeds of manumission, a whole company of our Volunteers threw down their arms and disbanded. I was so assured, as to think it probable, that the very arms we had furnished Kentucky would be turned against us. I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game. Kentucky gone, we can not hold Missouri, nor, as I think, Maryland. These all against us, and the job on our hands is too large for us. We would as well consent to separation at once, including the surrender of this capitol. On the contrary, if you will give up your restlessness for new positions, and back me manfully on the grounds upon which you and other kind friends gave me the election, and have approved in my public documents, we shall go through triumphantly.</p>
<p>You must not understand I took my course on the proclamation <span class="rend-i">because</span> of Kentucky. I took the same ground in a private letter to General Fremont before I heard from Kentucky.</p>
<p>You think I am inconsistent because I did not also forbid Gen. Fremont to shoot men under the proclamation. I understand that part to be within military law; but I also think, and so privately wrote Gen. Fremont, that it is impolitic in this, that our adversaries have the power, and will certainly exercise it, to shoot as many of our men as we shoot of theirs. I did not say this in the public letter, because it is a subject I prefer not to discuss in the hearing of our enemies.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;533</span>There has been no thought of removing Gen. Fremont on any ground connected with his proclamation; and if there has been any wish for his removal on any ground, our mutual friend Sam. Glover can probably tell you what it was. I hope no real necessity for it exists on any ground.</p>
<p>Suppose you write to Hurlbut and get him to resign.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_533_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_533_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> Your friend as ever A. LINCOLN</p>

If I thought you were in earnest I would certainly do it, as I could with great propriety, having in my possession his written pledge to resign if he drank a drop of liquor after going into the service. He has violated his pledge, and behaved badly, and ought to resign.'' (DLC-RTL). Hurlbut did not resign, of course, but served with distinction throughout the war. One of the charges preferred against General Fremont, however, was that he had permitted Hurlbut to `` . . . remain in command of the forces . . . in Northern Missouri from the tenth-day of August . . . to about the tenth-day of September . . . , knowing him . . . to be a common drunkard and unfit all of said time to command. . . .

<div class="opener">Washington, D.C. Sep. 29, 1861</div>
<p>His Excellency Gov. O. P. Morton: Your letter by the hand of Mr. Prunk<span class="ptr"><a name="4_541_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_541_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> FOOTNOTES}&gt;(2) was received yesterday. I write this letter because I wish you to believe of us (as we certainly believe of you) that we are doing the very best we can. You do not receive arms from us as fast as you need them; but it is because we have not near enough to meet all the pressing demands; and we are obliged to share around what we have, sending the larger share to the points which appear to need them most. We have great hope that our own supply will be ample before long, so that you and all others can have as many as you need. I see an article in an Indianapolis newspaper denouncing me for not answering your letter sent by a special messenger two or three weeks ago. I did make what I thought the best answer I could to that letter. As I remember, it asked for ten heavy guns to be distributed, with some troops, at Lawrenceburgh, Madison, New-Albany and Evansville; and I ordered the guns, and directed you to send the troops if you had them.</p>
<p>As to Kentucky, you do not estimate that state as more important than I do; but I am compelled to watch all points. While I write this I am, if not in <span class="rend-i">range</span>, at least in <span class="rend-i">hearing</span> of cannon-shot, from an army of enemies more than a hundred thousand strong. I do not expect them to capture this city; but I <span class="rend-i">know</span> they would, if I were to send the men and arms from here, to defend Louisville, of which there is not a single hostile armed soldier within forty miles, nor any force known to be moving upon it from any distance.</p>
<p>It is true, the Army in our front may make a half circle around Southward, and move on Louisville; but when they do, we will make a half circle around Northward, and meet them; and in<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;542</span>
the mean time we will get up what forces we can from other sources to also meet them.</p>
<p>I hope Zollicoffer has left Cumberland Gap (though I fear he has not) because, if he has, I rather infer he did it because of his dred of Camp Dick Robinson, re-inforced from Cincinnati, moving on him, than because of his intention to move on Louisville.<span class="ptr"><a name="4_542_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_542_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> FOOTNOTES}&gt;(3) But if he does go round and re-inforce Buckner, let Dick Robinson come round and re-inforce Sherman, and the thing is substantially as it was when Zollicoffer left Cumberland Gap. I state this as an illustration; for in fact, I think if the Gap is left open to us Dick Robinson should take it and hold it; while Indiana, and the vicinity of Louisville in Kentucky, can re-inforce Sherman faster than Zollicoffer can Buckner.</p>
<p>You requested that Lt. Col. Wood,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_542_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_542_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> FOOTNOTES}&gt;(4) of the Army, should be appointed a Brigadier General I will only say that very formidable objection has been made to this from Indiana.

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; Tracy, pp. 194-95. Benjamin F. Watson, appointed additional paymaster of Volunteers, September 5, 1861, had been postmaster at Lawrence, Massachusetts, under Pierce and Buchanan, but had been removed because it was understood by the Post Office Department that he had accepted a commission in the Sixth Massachusetts Infantry, a three-months regiment. Upon being mustered out August 2, Watson learned of his removal and telegraphed Lincoln. According to Watson's account, Lincoln's reply of August 8 (presumably not extant), enclosing a memorandum from the postmaster general, explained as follows: ``If I signed a paper, in making a change in the office, it was among others, without my being conscious of this particular one. . . . I shall talk fully with the Postmaster-General on the subject when I next see him.'' (Benjamin F.

<p>On, or about the 5th. of October, (the exact day to be determined hereafter) I wish a movement made to seize and hold a point on the Railroad connecting Virginia and Tennesse, near the Mountain pass called Cumberland Gap.</p>
<p>That point is now guarded against us by Zolicoffer, with 6000 or 8000, rebels at Barboursville, Kentucky, say twentyfive miles from the Gap towards Lexington.</p>
<p>We have a force of 5000 or 6000, under General Thomas,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_544_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_544_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> at Camp Dick Robinson, about twentyfive miles from Lexington, and seventyfive from Zollicoffer's camp on the road between the two, which is not a Railroad, anywhere between Lexington and the point to be seized---and along the whole length of which the Union sentiment among the people largely predominates.</p>
<p>We have military possession of the Railroads from Cincinnati to Lexington, and from Louisville to Lexington, and some Home Guards under General Crittenden<span class="ptr"><a name="4_544_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_544_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> are on the latter line.</p>
<p>We have possession of the Railroad from Louisville to Nashville, Tenn, so far as Muldrough's Hill, about forty miles, and the rebels have possession of that road all South of there. At the Hill we have a force of 8000 under Gen. Sherman;<span class="ptr"><a name="4_544_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_544_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[4]</a></span> and about an equal<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;545</span>
force of rebels is a very short distance South, under under [<span class="rend-i">sic</span>] Gen. Buckner.</p>
<p>We have a large force at Paducah, and a smaller at Fort-Holt, both on the Kentucky side, with some at Bird's Point, Cairo, Mound City, Evansville, &amp; New-Albany, all on the other side; and all which, with the Gun-Boats on the River, are, perhaps, sufficient to guard the Ohio from Louisville to it's mouth.</p>
<p>About supplies of troops, my general idea is that all from Wisconsin, Minesota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas, not now elsewhere, be left to <span class="rend-i">Fremont</span>.</p>
<p>All from Indiana and Michigan, not now elsewhere, be sent to Anderson at Louisville.</p>
<p>All from Ohio, needed in Western Virginia be sent there; and any remainder, be sent to Mitchell<span class="ptr"><a name="4_545_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_545_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[5]</a></span> at Cincinnati, for Anderson.</p>
<p>All East of the Mountains be appropriated to McClellan, and to the coast.</p>
<p>As to movements, my idea is that the one for the coast,<span class="ptr"><a name="4_545_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln4?id=4_545_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[6]</a></span> and that on Cumberland Gap be simultaneous; and that, in the mean time, preparation, vigilant watching, and the defensive only be acted upon---(this however, not to apply to Fremonts operations in Northern and middle Missouri)---that before these movements, Thomas and Sherman shall respectively watch, but not attack Zollicoffer, and Buckner.</p>
<p>That when the coast and Gap movements shall be ready, Sherman is merely to stand fast; while all at Cincincinnati [<span class="rend-i">sic</span>], and all at Louisville with all on the lines, concentrate rapidly at Lexington, and thence to Thomas' camp joining him, and the whole thence upon the Gap.</p>
<p>It is for the Military men to decide whether they can find a pass through the mountains at or near the Gap, which can not be defended by the enemy, with a greatly inferior force, and what is to be done in regard to this.</p>
<p>The Coast and Gap movements made, Generals McClellan and Fremont, in their respective Departments, will avail themselves of any advantages the diversions may present.</p>

<p>Concerning conditions at St. Louis, see Lincoln's communications to Curtis and Hunter, October 24, 1861, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>. Lincoln's communication to which Washburne replied has not been found. Meigs endorsed below Lincoln's endorsement on October 23: ``I have consulted Secy of War Order Maj [Robert E.] Clary to proceed with all despatch to St Louis relieve Maj Allen until Maj Allen recovers from his present illness sufficiently to return to duty. When Maj Allen recovers Maj Clary will proceed to the writer or report by letter to Gen Rosecrans &amp; take charge of the QM Depot in that Dept. locating himself where he can best supervise &amp; control it.''</p>

<div class="opener">Sir Washington Oct [23?] 1861</div>
<p>The proposed contract for Coal and privileges at the Isthmus of Chiriqui, with suggestions &amp; my conditional approval thereon---has been returned from the Navy Department because of the pressing business therein which does not allow the Secretary time to examine the subject</p>
<p>It is therefore referred to you with authority to act, and you are hereby authorized to carry the contract into effect, should the result of your examination be satisfactory and establish that it will prove of sufficient value to the government. The War, Navy, Post Office &amp; Interior Departments may all derive benefits from this proposed contract. The latter under the law of 3d March 1819 requires heavy appropriations for the transport &amp; support of captured Africans. It is possible that a modification of that law may make it a measure of great economy to direct there negroes to some of the unocupied lands of Central America, and the present contract, may if well considered and arranged, be the introduction to this, and an equally desirable measure to secure the removal of negroes from this country. I therefore recommend that all these points be considered and that the contract be so drawn as to secure such advantages as may in your judgement seem desirable for the United States to hold.</p>

<p>Secretary of the Interior</p>

Not in Lincoln's handwriting, the copy or draft may be what Lincoln sent or intended to send to Smith, but Lincoln's endorsement to Smith, October 24, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>, seems to indicate conclusively that the project was turned over to the Interior Department at this time. The Chiriqui Improvement Company headed by Ambrose W. Thompson of Philadelphia had in 1855 obtained control of several hundred thousand acres in Panama.

<p>one-half the price the government then paid (Thompson to Welles, August 8, 1861, DLC-RTL). Ninian W.

<p>Dear Sir On receipt of this, with the accompanying inclosures, you will take safe, certain, and suitable measures to have the inclosure addressed to Major General Fremont, delivered to him, with all reasonable despatch---subject to these conditions only, that if, when Gen. Fremont shall be reached by the messenger (yourself, or any one sent by you) he shall then have, in personal command, fought and won a battle, or shall then be actually in a battle, or shall then be in the immediate presence of the enemy, in expectation of a battle, it is not to be delivered, but held for further orders. After, and not till after, the delivery to Gen. Fremont, let the inclosure addressed to Gen. Hunter be delivered to him. Your Obt. Servt. A. Lincoln</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS, IHi. The enclosures referred to were undoubtedly <span class="rend-i">General Orders No. 18</span> and Lincoln's letter to General David Hunter, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>. It seems obvious, however, that after writing this letter to Curtis, Lincoln decided to withhold the letter to Hunter until a later date, thus allowing time for General Hunter to assume command before receiving Lincoln's suggestions (see Lincoln to Curtis, October 28, <span class="rend-i">infra). General Orders No. 18</span> (OR, I, III, 553) is as follows:</p>
<p>``Headquarters of the Army,</p>
<p>``Washington, October 24, 1861.</p>
<p>``Major-General Fremont, of the U.S. Army, the present commander of the Western Department of the same, will, on the receipt of this order, call Major-General Hunter, of the U.S. Volunteers, to relieve him temporarily in that command, when he (Major-General Fremont) will report to General Headquarters, by letter, for further orders. ``WINFIELD SCOTT.</p>
<p>``By command: E. D. TOWNSEND,</p>
<p>``Assistant Adjutant-General.''</p>
<p>Lincoln's precaution in withholding the letter to Hunter was justified, for General Fremont attempted to prevent the delivery of <span class="rend-i">General Orders No. 18</span>. Leonard Swett, by whom Lincoln dispatched the letter to Curtis, related the circumstances at length in a letter dated November 9, 1861, which reads in part as follows:</p>
<p>``Tuesday morning [October 29], I went immediately to Genl. Curtis . . . but I could not see him until evening . . . . we found numerous obstacles to the delivery of the order. It had unfortunately been announced in the New York papers, that the order was coming. Several St Louis men, who knew me came out on the same train. . . . It was therefore thought by Genl' Curtis &amp; myself that my connection with it might be suspected and some other person should take it through the lines. . . . Gen'l Curtis knew nothing of the character of these orders except what I, a stranger to him, told him. In the event of trouble, which<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;563</span>
he feared, it might be necessary for him . . . to <span class="rend-i">know</span> what it contained. . . . I opened one of the orders, took several copies, after which, the Genl enclosed it in a new envellop and directed it as before.</p>
<p>``The trouble of delivery was to get some reliable man, who had legitimate business inside Gen'l Fremont's lines. Capt [Ezekiel] Boyden, of Champaign Co. Ills . . . was selected as one, and Capt McKinney [Thomas J. McKenny?] . . . as the other. . . . McKinney took the originals and delivered them first.</p>
<p>``He arrived at Fremonts camp, at five oclock am. [November 1] having rode on horseback the two nights and day previous, having gone by Rolla. After waiting about five hours, and learning that there was no immediate prospect of battle, he applied at head quarters for admission The aid . . . told him he must make known his errand He declined, stating he must see the Gen'l &amp; could confer with no one else I omitted to say he was dressed for the trip like a country farmer. . . . Finally he was admitted. When the Gen'l read the order he said excitedly ``Sir, how did you get through my lines,'' when informed the Gen'l dismissed him. In a few moments . . . the aid came to him and told him not tell [<span class="rend-i">sic</span>] in camp the character of the order In a few moments more he came back again asking if Hunter knew of this To this . . . he responded as directed that a messenger had gone by Sedalia to give him a duplicate The messenger then tried to find where Hunter was. The soldiers did not know and the Genl's friends could not or would not tell. He tried to get a pass out of camp That was refused About eleven oclock at night, he overheard the password With that and an old pass of Gen'l Curtis he started &amp; got out The next day [November 2] about twelve oclock he found Hunter. . . .</p>
<p>``The following facts I learn from Capt J W Shaffer of Freeport As soon as the order arrived, Fremont ordered all his men to arms He sent back for Hunter'[s] division to march all night which they did, to join in the battle in the morning. When morning came, Fremont issued his Farewell address and left without giving any information about the Gov property There went with him, his body guard, 50 Indians and a paymaster with between 200000 &amp; 300,000$ The paymaster was arrested here last night and has some of the money. Hunter on taking command send [<span class="rend-i">sic</span>] cavalry scouts in all directions for from 30 to 40 miles but of course there was no enemy. . . .</p>
<p>``Let me tell a few more things which I have tried to investigate candidly &amp; believe to be true. Gen'l Fremont has talked about his signature to unlawful orders being above law &amp; to be obeyed The german people have talked about making him Dictator Some of his officers in quite high standing have talked so too.''</p>
<p>Fremont's order relinquishing his command to General Hunter was issued under date of November 2 (<span class="rend-i">General Orders No. 28</span>, OR, I, III, 559).</p>
