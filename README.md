# N-Gram Tracing

The method used in [this research](https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqy042) for authorship attribution of the [Bixby Letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bixby_letter) is novel in that it works for very short texts.

Since the original implementation is in perl and not available anywhere, I thought I would re-implement it in python and possibly dockerize it so anybody else could use it for analyzing their own datasets if they wanted.

...it is a work in progress.
