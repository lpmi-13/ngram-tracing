<div class="opener">Executive Mansion,<br>
Major General Banks Washington, Nov. 5. 1863.</div>
<p>Three months ago to-day I wrote you about Louisiana affairs, stating, on the word of Gov. Shepley, as I understood him, that Mr. Durant was taking a registry of citizens, preparatory to the election of a constitutional convention for that State. I sent a copy of the letter to Mr. Durant; and I now have his letter, written two months after, acknowledging receipt, and saying he is not taking such registry; and he does not let me know that he personally is expecting to do so. Mr. Flanders, to whom I also sent a copy, is now here, and he says nothing has yet been done. This disappoints me bitterly; yet I do not throw blame on you or on them. I do however, urge both you and them, to lose no more time. Gov. Shepley has special instructions from the War Department. I wish him---these gentlemen and others co-operating---without waiting for more territory, to go to work and give me a tangible nucleus which the remainder of the State may rally around as fast as it can, and which I can at once recognize and sustain as the true State government. And in that work I wish you, and all under your command, to give them a hearty sympathy and support. The instruction to Gov. Shepley bases the movement (and rightfully too) upon the loyal element. Time is important. There is danger, even now, that the adverse element seeks insidiously to pre-occupy the ground. If a few professedly loyal men shall draw the disloyal about them, and colorably set up a State government, repudiating the emancipation proclamation, and re-establishing slavery, I can not recognize or sustain their work. I should fall powerless in the attempt. This government, in such an attitude, would be a house divided against itself. I have said, and say again, that if a new State government, acting in harmony with this government, and consistently with general freedom, shall think best to adopt a reasonable temporary arrangement, in relation to the landless and homeless freed people, I do not object; but my word is out to be <span class="rend-i">for</span> and<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;2</span>
not <span class="rend-i">against</span> them on the question of their permanent freedom. I do not insist upon such temporary arrangement, but only say such would not be objectionable to me. Yours very truly</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS, CSmH. See Lincoln to Banks, August 5, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>. On October 1 Thomas J. Durant wrote Lincoln that, ``By your letter to General Banks, you appear to think that a Registration of voters is going on under my superintendence, with the view of bringing on the election of delegates to a Constitutional Convention; but such is not the case. The means of communicating with a large portion of the state, are not in our power, and before the commencement of a Registration we ought to have undisturbed control of a considerable territory, at least the two congressional districts proclaimed as not being in rebellion. . . .'' (Enclosed with Durant to Stanton, October 5, 1863, DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>On December 11 Benjamin F. Flanders wrote:</p>
<p>``I have shown the copy, which you permitted me to take, of your letter to General Banks, to Mr. Durant Mr. Hahn, Judge Whitaker and a few others of our prominent union men, and it gives to all of them great encouragement and satisfaction.</p>
<p>``The letter has had the desired effect upon the Military leaders; they are stimulated to action by it.</p>
<p>``There is now, and I believe there will continue to be a commendable zeal and entire unity of action among the friends of the Government and its officers civil &amp; military in the movement to form a State, a <span class="rend-i">free</span> State government for Louisiana. The measures taken for this great object will I think be stamped with prudence, and we hope their result will meet your expectations.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADfS, DLC-RTL. See note to Lincoln's memorandum of November 2, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>. On November 4 Diller wrote Lincoln from Willard's Hotel: ``I find that my health is suffering by remaining here, and I beg you to accept this as my excuse for troubling you with this letter.</p>
<p>``It is important that I should be placed in possession of the views of Your Excellency with regard to this powder matter, at your earliest convenience, in order that many expenses, such as the rent of the building at Westville, N.J. the services of a watchman, &amp;c &amp;c. may be stopped. There is plenty of powder already made to test its merits . . . and with your permission will join my family in Illinois and there await the result. . . .'' Diller continued with an expression of hope that Dr. Charles M. Wetherill would not ``suffer in consequence'' of his services on the powder project: ``Should it be the pleasure of Your Excellency to remand him to the Department from which he was detailed, and he is now in this City awaiting that pleasure, I beg that the Commissioner of Agriculture may be informed of your wishes in regard to his future position. . . . The Commissioner should issue to Dr. Wetherill, a salary upon which he can live respectably with his family in Washington. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>Concerning Wetherill's dismissal from his post as chief chemist of the Department of Agriculture, Representative-elect Godlove S. Orth of Lafayette, Indiana, wrote Lincoln on October 16, 1863:</p>
<p>``I regret to learn that a constituent of mine, Dr. C. M. Wetherill `Chemist of the Dept. of Agriculture,' has received from the Agricultural Comr. under date of Oct. 1, a rather summary dismissal from that Department.</p>
<p>``Dr. W. was specially detailed by your order, of date April 4, '63, for 30 days to make certain experiments in Gunpowder, which detail was afterwards on the 2nd. day of May extended by the Comr. `until notified to the contrary.'</p>
<p>``Under this state of facts Dr. W. and his friends regard the action of the</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;4</span>Commissioner as harsh and arbitrary and look with confidence to your kind sense of Justice to see that Dr. W. is not thus summarily dealt with. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>Apparently Lincoln took some sort of action, for a contemporary copy of Isaac Newton's letter to Wetherill, dated ``Novr. 1863'' reads as follows:</p>
<p>``Your salary as Chemist of the Department of Agriculture will be fixed at the rate of $2500 per annum, to commence from November 1st. of the current year.</p>
<p>``I will grant you a furlough of two weeks from the date of your remand to this Department for the purpose of bringing your family from the West.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS, RPB. Burnside replied at 1 A.M. on November 12: ``Your dispatch received. The Telegraph lines have been down since Saturday night, so that we could not communicate with Genl Grant. Our loss at Rogersville was about five hundred (500) old troops and one hundred &amp; fifty (150) new troops. Four (4) pieces of artillery and thirty six (36) wagons with all the baggage &amp; ammunition of two (2) Regts &amp; a battery the principal loss was in the Second Tennessee mounted Infantry. The Seventh Ohio Cavalry lost about one hundred (100) men &amp; Phillips Illinois Battery about forty (40). The force at that point consisted of these two (2) Regts &amp; the Phillips Battery with some recruits for a new Tennessee Regt. The rebel attacking force amounted to thirty five hundred (3500) mounted men under Gen Sam Jones. They captured about six hundred horses &amp; equipment &amp; as many stand of small arms. An investigation is being made as to the cause of defeat. I at first thought it was the result of carelessness on the part of the Comdg Officer Col Garrard &amp; want of steadiness on the part of the men but as the Investigation progresses I am becoming satisfied that it is result of the necessity for holding so long a line between two formidable forces of the Enemy.

<p>In a conversation with Gen. Butler he made a suggestion which impressed me a good deal at the time. It was that, as a preliminary step, a vote be taken, yea or nay, whether there shall be a State convention to repeal the Ordinance of secession, and remodel the State constitution. I send it merely as a suggestion for your consideration, not having considered it maturely myself. The point which impressed me was, not so much the questions to be voted on, as the effect of chrystallizing, so to speak, in taking such popular vote on any proper question. In fact, I have always thought the act of secession is legally nothing, and needs no repealing. Turn the thought over in your mind, and see if in your own judgment, you can make any thing of it.

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADfS, DLC-RTL. The letter from defeated congressman John M. Crisfield, November 8, 1863, enclosed by Blair with a note dated November 11, is as follows:</p>
<p>``Order No 53 of Gen. Schenck is already known to you. In obedience to that order, large bodies of troops were moved into this Congressional District on Monday last; and between that and Wednesday morning, the day of the election, they were distributed to all the voting places, where they remained during the day, watching and interfering with the election.</p>
<p>``In my own County, (Somerset), some two or three hundred cavalry, fully armed, with carbines, swords, &amp; pistols, and well mounted, were marched through various parts of the County on Tuesday; and at the hour of opening the polls on Wednesday morning, they were found at each voting place, in squads, numbering from 5 to 30 each. They at once took control of the election, and had it all their own way. . . . in the Union districts, where I was supposed to be strong, their control was exercised in the most absolute way. In one Election District, (Tangier), the officer pulled from his pocket a yellow, or Cresswell [John A. J. Creswell] ticket, and said that no other was to be voted there . . . and every man approaching the polls, with any other ticket, was turned back by an armed force. . . . In . . . other districts . . . the same thing was done . . . many persons who offered to take the oath prescribed by Order No. 53, and were legally qualified voters, were turned down. . . . In . . . Hungary Neck, the officer in command at the opening of the Polls, ordered every ticket to be examined, before it was put into the box; and if it had my name on it, the voter was required to take the oath before the ballot could go in. . . . The consequence was, not over 50 pr. ct. of the vote of the District was cast. . . . In this election District (Princess Anne) the polls were surrounded by the cavalry dismounted, and armed as stated; and each voter was obliged to come up, one at a time, through files of soldiers, to the box, where stood the commanding officer, (Capt [Charles C.] Moore 3rd Md. Cavalry) challenging each as he came up, and requiring oath to be administered to him, before the vote was received. One vote was so received; when the next came<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;10</span>
up, who happened to be my son, the Captain challenged him, and before the oath was put to him, commenced a series of questions as to his loyalty, and political opinions, the means of suppressing the rebellion, his willingness to give up <span class="rend-i">all his property</span> to put down the rebellion, &amp;c. and when he had got through, he turned to the judges, and ordered the oath to be administered. At this point the judges said, `we do not approve of this mode of conducting the election---, we must adhere to the laws of the state; and if we are not permitted to do so, we submit to arrest.' (The Capt had previously told them that unless they obeyed his orders, he would arrest them), and thereupon he did arrest them, and sent them off, under guard, to Gen. Schenck's Head-Quarters, and the election was broken up. The judges were on the bench just 12 minutes, and had taken but one vote. They proceeded to Salisbury, under guard, to take the train for Baltimore, and while waiting for that purpose, were put into the Guard House. After remaining there awhile, by the interference of Gen Lockwood, as was understood, they were released and reached home at one o'clock, on the following morning. . . . Capt. Moore said he had orders for his act but he did not exhibit them, as far as I know. I was an eye witness to this scene. . . .</p>
<p>``Proceedings of the same general nature, occurred in . . . every County. . . . In regard to this county authentic statements, verified by the most respectable witnesses, have been prepared; the originals of which have been sent to the Governor, and copies will be published in the County paper, a copy of which will be sent to you.</p>
<p>``It is not for me to suggest what can, or ought to, be done, but . . . public indignation is very highly aroused and will not be appeased, unless the proceedings of these military officers be disavowed and rebuked, and some assurance be given, that the outrage is not to be repeated. . . .''

<p>The President then accepted the cane, and, with much emotion, replied that he never personally knew the Senator's friend, Mr. Broderick, but he had always heard him spoken of as one sincerely devoted to the cause of human rights. Testimony to this point of his character had been borne by those whom he had not intimately known, as also by those with whom he was personally and intimately acquainted, and, with all of them, the testimony had been uniform. The memento which was presented him by Senator Conness was of that class of things, the highest honor that could be conferred upon him. If, in the position he had been placed, he had done anything that entitled him to the honor the Senator had assigned him, it was a proud reflection that his acts were of such a character as to merit the affiliation of the friends of a man like David C. Broderick. Whether remaining in this world or looking down upon the earth from the spirit land, to be remembered by such a man as David C. Broderick was a fact he would remember through all the years of his life. The proudest ambition he could desire was to do something for the elevation of the condition of his fellow-man. In conclusion, he returned his sincere thanks for the part the Senator bore in this presentation, and to the memory of his great friend.</p>

<p>[2]&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that the first page of this draft was written in ink on Executive Mansion stationery indicates that this page was written at Washington before Lincoln went to Gettysburg. Since the page ends in an incomplete sentence, it may be inferred that there was also a second page written in Washington. The only extant second page, however, written in pencil on lined paper, shows indications of being a copy, presumably of an original page so completely revised and overwritten that Lincoln threw it away. It is also possible, however, that this copy was made from the second draft (see note 3), or possibly from a still different draft of which we have no knowledge.</p>
<p>When he made the copy is another matter of uncertainty. According to John G. Nicolay, he wrote it at Gettysburg on the morning of November 19 (for Nicolay's complete account, see <span class="rend-i">Century Magazine</span>, new series, XXV, 596-608); but it is also possible that he wrote this page on the night of November 18 and the second draft on the 19th (see William E. Barton, <span class="rend-i">Lincoln at Gettysburg</span>, pp. 68 ff.).</p>

<p>[3]&nbsp;&nbsp; The last three words written in ink on the first page, ``to stand here,'' were deleted by Lincoln and ``we here be dedica-'' inserted in pencil. If the extant second page of the first draft is a copy, in making the copy Lincoln presumably erred in beginning the revision at the end of page one with the word ``dedicated'' which appears in line 17 of the second draft, instead of beginning with the word ``dedicated'' in line 15.</p>
</div>
<a name="7_18_2"></a><div class="textindentlevelx" id="7_18_2">
<p>[4]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADf, DLC. This draft is written on lined paper similar to the extant second page of the first draft. The emendations which appear in this draft and the important revisions from the first draft are indicated in succeeding notes.</p>
<p>The exact relationship between the first and second drafts cannot now be established beyond question, for certain emendations in the second draft restore the reading of the first draft. Some of these emendations, however, must have been made after Lincoln delivered the speech, for the newspaper versions follow in some instances the original wording of this draft rather than the emendations (notes 6, 7, 8, 12). Thus it would seem that although Lincoln spoke from the second draft as first written, and perhaps partially revised, he did not read it verbatim. He probably made further changes in this draft after the address to make it conform to what he said.</p>
<p>Nicolay states that Lincoln prepared ``a new autograph copy'' after he consulted newspaper reports of the address. Possibly Nicolay referred to the Everett copy (<span class="rend-i">infra</span>), which we do not know to have been prepared after rather than before receipt of Everett's letter of January 30, 1864. It has also been supposed that there was once an autograph copy prepared for Judge David Wills, at whose home Lincoln stayed on the night before the dedication ceremony, but this supposed copy has never been located. In any event Nicolay's account is incomplete and vague, and shows no acquaintance with the second draft.</p>

<p>[19]&nbsp;&nbsp; New York <span class="rend-i">Tribune, Times</span>, and <span class="rend-i">Herald</span>, November 20, 1863. Except for minor differences in punctuation and capitalization, the text is the same in all three papers and is the Associated Press version prepared by Joseph L. Gilbert. According to Gilbert's later account, his text was prepared partly from his shorthand notes and partly from Lincoln's manuscript (see Barton, <span class="rend-i">op. cit</span>., pp. 189-92). Since this version follows closely the second draft prior to its having been emended, down to the final sentence, we have to account chiefly for the variants between the newspaper text and the second draft in this final sentence. All of these variants may be explained by the hypothesis that Lincoln did not read his manuscript verbatim, and hence Gilbert's shorthand followed the spoken word. Some of them may be accounted for as errors, which in spite of having access to the manuscript Gilbert did not correct, or which occurred in transcription. In any event Gilbert seems not to have relied on the manuscript for Lincoln's last sentence.</p>
<p>Aside from Gilbert's text there are several independent newspaper texts, of varying degrees of reliability, such as those in the Chicago <span class="rend-i">Tribune</span> and Philadelphia <span class="rend-i">Inquirer</span>. Inferior in general, they are important chiefly in establishing one word, ``poor,'' omitted by Gilbert, which Lincoln assuredly must have spoken and which appears in both first and second drafts. ``Our poor power,'' rather than Gilbert's ``our power,'' appears in the Chicago <span class="rend-i">Tribune</span>, and the Philadelphia <span class="rend-i">Inquirer</span> has ``our poor attempts,'' in texts prepared independently of each other, and also independently of the Associated Press text. These papers corroborate Gilbert's version, however, in having the phrase ``under God,'' which Lincoln must have used for the first time as he spoke.</p>
<p>Barton (<span class="rend-i">op. cit</span>., pp. 80-83) credits the text taken down in shorthand by Charles Hale of the Boston <span class="rend-i">Advertiser</span> as being ``what Lincoln actually said,'' and gives it preference over Gilbert's text chiefly on the ground that Gilbert consulted Lincoln's manuscript, whereas Hale relied solely on his shorthand notes. The few particulars in which Hale's version differs from Gilbert's have been indicated in footnotes. In one particular, however, it may be questioned whether Hale was accurate---along with Gilbert he omits ``poor'' from ``our poor power.'' It is difficult to comprehend how ``poor'' found its way into other newspaper reports unless Lincoln spoke the word, and yet both Gilbert and Hale omitted it.</p>
</div>
<a name="7_20_1"></a><div class="textindentlevelx" id="7_20_1">
<p>[20]&nbsp;&nbsp; Hale's text and that of the Chicago <span class="rend-i">Tribune</span> are ``have given.''</p>

For particulars see the note to Lincoln's letter to Everett, February 4, 1864, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>. It is not certain that this copy was made specifically for this purpose after receipt of Everett's letter of January 30, and quite probably it may have been made earlier. In either case, comparison of the Everett copy with the first and second drafts and with the newspaper versions shows it to have been made as a careful revision, incorporating the phrase ``under God'' and other minor changes from the newspapers, and making additional revisions as indicated in the succeeding notes, but in general following the revised second draft.</p>

This text is notable chiefly for Lincoln's change of ``upon this continent'' to ``on this continent.''

Only one change in wording, as noted, was made in this copy from the Bancroft copy.

<p>Your kind note of to-day is received. In our respective parts yesterday, you could not have been excused to make a short address, nor I a long one. I am pleased to know that, in your judgment, the little I did say was not entirely a failure. Of course I knew Mr. Everett would not fail; and yet, while the whole discourse was eminently satisfactory, and will be of great value, there were passages in it which trancended my expectation. The point made against the theory of the general government being only an agency, whose principals are the States, was new to me, and, as I think, is one of the best arguments for the national supremacy. The tribute to our noble women for their angel-ministering to the suffering soldiers, surpasses, in its way, as do the subjects of it, whatever has gone before.</p>

<p>``Your kind note is at hand. I do not know enough of naval arrangements to understand whether the position you name offers preferment to the capable and industrious or not.

<p>``Last fall when he was here you gave his son Frank an appointment to West Point . . . which his father expected him to enter next June.</p>

Honor also to the citizen who cares for his brother in the field, and serves, as he best can, the same cause---honor to him, only less than to him, who braves, for the common good, the storms of heaven and the storms of battle. Your Obt. Servt</p>

<div class="opener">December 8, 1863</div>
<p>Fellow citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:</p>
<p>Another year of health, and of sufficiently abundant harvests has passed. For these, and especially for the improved condition of our national affairs, our renewed, and profoundest gratitude to God is due.</p>
<p>We remain in peace and friendship with foreign powers.</p>
<p>The efforts of disloyal citizens of the United States to involve us in foreign wars, to aid an inexcusable insurrection, have been unavailing. Her Britannic Majesty's government, as was justly expected, have exercised their authority to prevent the departure of new hostile expeditions from British ports. The Emperor of France has, by a like proceeding, promptly vindicated the neutrality which he proclaimed at the beginning of the contest. Questions of great intricacy and importance have arisen out of the blockade, and other belligerent operations, between the government and several of the maritime powers, but they have been discussed, and, as far as was possible, accommodated in a spirit of frankness, justice, and mutual good will. It is especially gratifying that our prize courts, by the impartiality of their adjudications, have commanded the respect and confidence of maritime powers.</p>
<p>The supplemental treaty between the United States and Great Britain for the suppression of the African slave trade, made on the 17th. day of February last, has been duly ratified, and carried into execution.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_36_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_36_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> It is believed that, so far as American ports and American citizens are concerned, that inhuman and odious traffic has been brought to an end.</p>
<p>I shall submit, for the consideration of the Senate, a convention for the adjustment of possessory claims in Washington Territory, arising out of the treaty of the 15th. June, 1846, between the United States and Great Britain, and which have been the source<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;37</span>
of some disquiet among the citizens of that now rapidly improving part of the country.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_37_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_37_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span></p>
<p>A novel and important question, involving the extent of the maritime jurisdiction of Spain in the waters which surround the island of Cuba, has been debated without reaching an agreement, and it is proposed in an amicable spirit to refer it to the arbitrament of a friendly power. A convention for that purpose will be submitted to the Senate.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_37_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_37_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[4]</a></span></p>
<p>I have thought it proper, subject to the approval of the Senate, to concur with the interested commercial powers in an arrangement for the liquidation of the Scheldt dues upon the principles which have been heretofore adopted in regard to the imposts upon navigation in the waters of Denmark.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_37_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_37_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[5]</a></span></p>
<p>The long pending controversy between this government and that of Chili touching the seizure at Sitana, in Peru, by Chilian officers, of a large amount in treasure belonging to citizens of the United States, has been brought to a close by the award of His Majesty, the King of the Belgians, to whose arbitration the question was referred by the parties.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_37_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_37_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[6]</a></span> The subject was thoroughly and patiently examined by that justly respected magistrate, and although the sum awarded to the claimants may not have been as large as they expected, there is no reason to distrust the wisdom of his Majesty's decision. That decision was promptly complied with by Chili, when intelligence in regard to it reached that country.</p>
<p>The joint commission, under the act of the last session, for carrying into effect the convention with Peru on the subject of claims, has been organized at Lima, and is engaged in the business intrusted to it.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_37_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_37_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[7]</a></span></p>
<p>Difficulties concerning inter-oceanic transit through Nicaragua are in course of amicable adjustment.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_37_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_37_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[8]</a></span></p>
<p>In conformity with principles set forth in my last annual message, I have received a representative from the United States of Colombia, and have accredited a minister to that republic.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_37_7"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_37_7;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[9]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;38</span>Incidents occurring in the progress of our civil war have forced upon my attention the uncertain state of international questions, touching the rights of foreigners in this country and of United States citizens abroad.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_38_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_38_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[10]</a></span> In regard to some governments these rights are at least partially defined by treaties. In no instance, however, is it expressly stipulated that, in the event of civil war, a foreigner residing in this country, within the lines of the insurgents, is to be exempted from the rule which classes him as a belligerent, in whose behalf the government of his country cannot expect any privileges or immunities distinct from that character. I regret to say, however, that such claims have been put forward, and, in some instances, in behalf of foreigners who have lived in the United States the greater part of their lives.</p>
<p>There is reason to believe that many persons born in foreign countries, who have declared their intention to become citizens, or who have been fully naturalized, have evaded the military duty required of them by denying the fact, and thereby throwing upon the government the burden of proof. It has been found difficult or impracticable to obtain this proof from the want of guides to the proper sources of information. These might be supplied by requiring clerks of courts, where declarations of intention may be made or naturalizations effected, to send, periodically, lists of the names of the persons naturalized, or declaring their intention to become citizens, to the Secretary of the Interior, in whose department those names might be arranged and printed for general information.</p>
<p>There is also reason to believe that foreigners frequently become citizens of the United States for the sole purpose of evading duties imposed by the laws of their native countries, to which, on becoming naturalized here, they at once repair, and though never returning to the United States, they still claim the interposition of this government as citizens. Many altercations and great prejudices have heretofore arisen out of this abuse. It is therefore, submitted to your serious consideration. It might be advisable to fix a limit, beyond which no Citizen of the United States residing abroad may claim the interposition of his government.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_38_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_38_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[11]</a></span></p>
<p>The right of suffrage has often been assumed and exercised by aliens, under pretences of naturalization, which they have disavowed when drafted into the military service. I submit the expediency of such an amendment of the law as will make the fact of voting an estoppel against any plea of exemption from military<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;39</span>
service, or other civil obligation, on the ground of alienage.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_39_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_39_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[12]</a></span></p>
<p>In common with other western powers, our relations with Japan have been brought into serious jeopardy, through the perverse opposition of the hereditary aristocracy of the empire, to the enlightened and liberal policy of the Tycoon designed to bring the country into the society of nations. It is hoped, although not with entire confidence, that these difficulties may be peacefully overcome. I ask your attention to the claim of the Minister residing there for the damages he sustained in the destruction by fire of the residence of the legation at Yedo.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_39_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_39_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[13]</a></span></p>
<p>Satisfactory<span class="ptr"><a name="7_39_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_39_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[14]</a></span> arrangements have been made with the Emperor of Russia, which, it is believed, will result in effecting a continuous line of telegraph through that empire from our Pacific coast.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_39_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_39_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[15]</a></span></p>
<p>I recommend to your favorable consideration the subject of an international telegraph across the Atlantic ocean; and also of a telegraph between this capital and the national forts along the Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_39_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_39_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[16]</a></span> Such communications, established with any reasonable outlay, would be economical as well as effective aids to the diplomatic, military, and naval service.</p>
<p>The consular system of the United States, under the enactments of the last Congress, begins to be self-sustaining;<span class="ptr"><a name="7_39_6"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_39_6;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[17]</a></span> and there is<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;40</span>
reason to hope that it may become entirely so, with the increase of trade which will ensue whenever peace is restored. Our ministers abroad have been faithful in defending American rights. In protecting commercial interests, our Consuls have necessarily had to encounter increased labors and responsibilities, growing out of the war. These they have, for the most part, met and discharged with zeal and efficiency. This acknowledgment justly includes those Consuls who, residing in Morocco, Egypt, Turkey, Japan, China, and other oriental countries, are charged with complex functions and extraordinary powers.</p>
<p>The condition of the several organized Territories is generally satisfactory, although Indian disturbances in New Mexico have not been entirely suppressed. The mineral resources of Colorado, Nevada, Idaho, New Mexico, and Arizona are proving far richer than has been heretofore understood. I lay before you a communication on this subject from the governor of New Mexico.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_40_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_40_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[18]</a></span> I again submit to your consideration the expediency of establishing a system for the encouragement of immigration. Although this source of national wealth and strength is again flowing with greater freedom than for several years before the insurrection occurred, there is still a great deficiency of laborers in every field of industry, especially in agriculture and in our mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals. While the demand for labor is thus increased here, tens of thousands of persons, destitute of remunerative occupation, are thronging our foreign consulates, and offering to emigrate to the United States if essential, but very cheap, assistance can be afforded them. It is easy to see that, under the sharp discipline of civil war, the nation is beginning a new life. This noble effort demands the aid, and ought to receive the attention and support of the government.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_40_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_40_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[19]</a></span></p>
<p>Injuries, unforseen by the government and unintended, may, in some cases, have been inflicted on the subjects or citizens of foreign countries, both at sea and on land, by persons in the service of the United States. As this government expects redress from other powers when similar injuries are inflicted by persons in their service upon citizens of the United States, we must be prepared to do justice to foreigners. If the existing judicial tribunals are inadequate to this purpose, a special court may be authorized, with power to hear and decide such claims of the character referred to as may have arisen under treaties and the public law. Conventions<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;41</span>
for adjusting the claims by joint commission have been proposed to some governments, but no definitive answer to the proposition has yet been received from any.</p>
<p>In the course of the session I shall probably have occasion to request you to provide indemnification to claimants where decrees of restitution have been rendered, and damages awarded by admiralty courts; and in other cases where this government may be acknowledged to be liable in principle, and where the amount of that liability has been ascertained by an informal arbitration.</p>
<p>The proper officers of the treasury have deemed themselves required, by the law of the United States upon the subject, to demand a tax upon the incomes of foreign consuls in this country. While such a demand may not, in strictness, be in derogation of public law, or perhaps of any existing treaty between the United States and a foreign country, the expediency of so far modifying the act as to exempt from tax the income of such consuls as are not citizens of the United States, derived from the emoluments of their office, or from property not situated in the United States, is submitted to your serious consideration.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_41_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_41_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[20]</a></span> I make this suggestion upon the ground that a comity which ought to be reciprocated exempts our Consuls, in all other countries, from taxation to the extent thus indicated. The United States, I think, ought not to be exceptionally illiberal to international trade and commerce.</p>
<p>The operations of the treasury during the last year have been successfully conducted. The enactment by Congress of a national banking law<span class="ptr"><a name="7_41_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_41_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[21]</a></span> has proved a valuable support of the public credit; and the general legislation in relation to loans has fully answered the expectations of its favorers. Some amendments may be required to perfect existing laws; but no change in their principles or general scope is believed to be needed.</p>
<p>Since these measures have been in operation, all demands on the treasury, including the pay of the army and navy, have been promptly met and fully satisfied. No considerable body of troops, it is believed, were ever more amply provided, and more liberally and punctually paid; and it may be added that by no people were the burdens incident to a great war ever more cheerfully borne.</p>
<p>The receipts during the year from all sources, including loans and the balance in the treasury at its commencement, were $901,125,674 86, and the aggregate disbursements $895,796,630.65, leaving a balance on the 1st. July, 1863, of $5,329,044.21. Of the<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;42</span>
receipts there were derived from customs, $69,059,642.40; from internal revenue, $37,640,787.95; from direct tax, $1,485,103.61; from lands, $167,617.17; from miscellaneous sources, $3,046,615.35; and from loans, $776,682,361.57; making the aggregate, $901,125,674.86. Of the disbursements there were for the civil service, $23,253,922.08; for pensions and Indians, $4,216,520.79; for interest on public debt, $24,729,846.51;<span class="ptr"><a name="7_42_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_42_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[22]</a></span> for the War Department, $599,298,600.83; for the Navy Department, $63,211,105.27; for payment of funded and temporary debt, $181,086,635.07; making the aggregate, $895,796,630.65, and leaving the balance of $5,329,044.21. But the payment of funded and temporary debt, having been made from moneys borrowed during the year, must be regarded as merely nominal payments, and the moneys borrowed to make them as merely nominal receipts; and the amount, $181,086,635 07, should therefore be deducted both from receipts and disbursements. This being done, there remains as actual receipts $720,039,039.79; and the actual disbursements, $714,709,995.58, leaving the balance as already stated.</p>
<p>The actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter, and the estimated receipts and disbursements for the remaining three quarters, of the current fiscal year, 1864, will be shown in detail by the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, to which I invite your attention. It is sufficient to say here that it is not believed that actual results will exhibit a state of the finances less favorable to the country than the estimates of that officer heretofore submitted; while it is confidently expected that at the close of the year both disbursements and debt will be found very considerably less than has been anticipated.</p>
<p>The report of the Secretary of War is a document of great interest. It consists of---</p>
<p>1. The military operations of the year, detailed in the report of the general-in-chief.</p>
<p>2. The organization of colored persons into the war service.</p>
<p>3. The exchange of prisoners, fully set forth in the letter of General Hitchcock.</p>
<p>4. The operations under the act for enrolling and calling out the national forces, detailed in the report of the provost marshal general.</p>
<p>5. The organization of the invalid corps; and</p>
<p>6. The operation of the several departments of the quartermaster general, commissary general, paymaster general, chief of engineers, chief of ordnance, and surgeon general.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;43</span>It has appeared impossible to make a valuable summary of this report except such as would be too extended for this place, and hence I content myself by asking your careful attention to the report itself.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_43_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_43_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[23]</a></span></p>
<p>The duties devolving on the naval branch of the service during the year, and throughout the whole of this unhappy contest, have been discharged with fidelity and eminent success. The extensive blockade has been constantly increasing in efficiency, as the navy has expanded; yet on so long a line it has so far been impossible to entirely suppress illicit trade. From returns received at the Navy Department, it appears that more than one thousand vessels have been captured since the blockade was instituted, and that the value of prizes already sent in for adjudication amounts to over thirteen millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The naval force of the United States consists at this time of five hundred and eighty-eight vessels, completed and in the course of completion, and of these seventy-five are iron-clad or armored steamers.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_43_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_43_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[24]</a></span> The events of the war give an increased interest and importance to the navy which will probably extend beyond the war itself.</p>
<p>The armored vessels in our navy completed and in service, or which are under contract and approaching completion, are believed to exceed in number those of any other power. But while these may be relied upon for harbor defence and coast service, others of greater strength and capacity will be necessary for cruising purposes, and to maintain our rightful position on the ocean.</p>
<p>The change that has taken place in naval vessels and naval warfare, since the introduction of steam as a motive-power for ships-of-war, demands either a corresponding change in some of our existing navy yards, or the establishment of new ones, for the construction and necessary repair of modern naval vessels. No inconsiderable<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;44</span>
embarrassment, delay, and public injury have been experienced from the want of such governmental establishments. The necessity of such a navy yard, so furnished, at some suitable place upon the Atlantic seaboard, has on repeated occasions been brought to the attention of Congress by the Navy Department, and is again presented in the report of the Secretary which accompanies this communication. I think it my duty to invite your special attention to this subject, and also to that of establishing a yard and depot for naval purposes upon one of the western rivers.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_44_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_44_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[25]</a></span> A naval force has been created on those interior waters, and under many disadvantages, within little more than two years, exceeding in numbers the whole naval force of the country at the commencement of the present administration. Satisfactory and important as have been the performances of the heroic men of the navy at this interesting period, they are scarcely more wonderful than the success of our mechanics and artisans in the production of war vessels which has created a new form of naval power.</p>
<p>Our country has advantages superior to any other nation in our resources of iron and timber, with inexhaustible quantities of fuel in the immediate vicinity of both, and all available and in close proximity to navigable waters. Without the advantage of public works the resources of the nation have been developed and its power displayed in the construction of a navy of such magnitude which has, at the very period of its creation, rendered signal service to the Union.</p>
<p>The increase of the number of seamen in the public service, from seven thousand five hundred men, in the spring of 1861, to about thirty four thousand at the present time has been accomplished without special legislation, or extraordinary bounties to promote that increase. It has been found, however, that the operation of the draft, with the high bounties paid for army recruits, is beginning to affect injuriously the naval service, and will, if not corrected, be likely to impair its efficiency, by detaching seamen from their proper vocation and inducing them to enter the Army.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_44_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_44_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[26]</a></span> I<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;45</span>
therefore respectfully suggest that Congress might aid both the army and naval services by a definite provision on this subject, which would at the same time be equitable to the communities more especially interested.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_45_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_45_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[27]</a></span></p>
<p>I commend to your consideration the suggestions of the Secretary of the Navy in regard to the policy of fostering and training seamen,<span class="ptr"><a name="7_45_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_45_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[28]</a></span> and also the education of officers and engineers for the naval service. The Naval Academy is rendering signal service in preparing midshipmen for the highly responsible duties which in after life they will be required to perform. In order that the country should not be deprived of the proper quota of educated officers, for which legal provision has been made at the naval school, the vacancies caused by the neglect or omission to make nominations from the States in insurrection have been filled by the Secretary of the Navy.</p>
<p>The school is now more full and complete than at any former period, and in every respect to the favorable consideration of Congress.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_45_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_45_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[29]</a></span></p>
<p>During the past fiscal year the financial condition of the Post<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;46</span>
office Department has been one of increasing prosperity, and I am gratified in being able to state that the actual postal revenue has nearly equalled the entire expenditures; the latter amounting to $11,314,206.84, and the former to $11,163,789 59, leaving a deficiency of but $150,417 25. In 1860, the year immediately preceding the rebellion the deficiency amounted to $5,656,705 49, the postal receipts of that year being $2,645,722 19 less than those of 1863. The decrease since 1860 in the annual amount of transportation has been only about 25 per cent, but the annual expenditure on account of the same has been reduced 35 per cent. It is manifest, therefore, that the Post Office Department may become self-sustaining in a few years, even with the restoration of the whole service.</p>
<p>The international conference of postal delegates from the principal countries of Europe and America, which was called at the suggestion of the Postmaster General, met at Paris on the 11th of May last, and concluded its deliberations on the 8th of June. The principles established by the conference as best adapted to facilitate postal intercourse between nations, and as the basis of future postal conventions, inaugurate a general system of uniform international charges, at reduced rates of postage, and cannot fail to produce beneficial results.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_46_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_46_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[30]</a></span></p>
<p>I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Interior, which is herewith laid before you, for useful and varied information in relation to the public lands, Indian affairs, patents, pensions, and other matters of public concern pertaining to his department.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_46_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_46_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[31]</a></span></p>
<p>The quantity of land disposed of during the last and the first quarter of the present fiscal years was three million eight hundred and forty one thousand five hundred and forty nine acres, of which one hundred and sixty one thousand nine hundred and eleven acres were sold for cash, one million four hundred and fifty six thousand five hundred and fourteen acres were taken up under the homestead law, and the residue disposed of under laws granting lands for military bounties, for railroad and other purposes. It also appears that the sale of the public lands is largely on the increase.</p>
<p>It has long been a cherished opinion of some of our wisest statesmen that the people of the United States had a higher and more enduring interest in the early settlement and substantial cultivation of the public lands than in the amount of direct revenue to be derived from the sale of them. This opinion has had a controlling influence in shaping legislation upon the subject of our national<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;47</span>
domain. I may cite, as evidence of this, the liberal measures adopted in reference to actual settlers; the grant to the States of the overflowed lands within their limits in order to their being reclaimed and rendered fit for cultivation; the grants to railway companies of alternate sections of land upon the contemplated lines of their roads which, when completed, will so largely multiply the facilities for reaching our distant possessions. This policy has received its most signal and beneficent illustration in the recent enactment granting homesteads to actual settlers.</p>
<p>Since the first day of January last the before-mentioned quantity of one million four hundred and fifty-six thousand five hundred and fourteen acres of land have been taken up under its provisions. This fact and the amount of sales furnish gratifying evidence of increasing settlement upon the public lands, notwithstanding the great struggle in which the energies of the nation have been engaged, and which has required so large a withdrawal of our citizens from their accustomed pursuits. I cordially concur in the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior suggesting a modification of the act in favor of those engaged in the military and naval service of the United States. I doubt not that Congress will cheerfully adopt such measures as will, without essentially changing the general features of the system, secure to the greatest practicable extent, its benefits to those who have left their homes in the defence of the country in this arduous crisis.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_47_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_47_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[32]</a></span></p>
<p>I invite your attention to the views of the Secretary as to the propriety of raising by appropriate legislation a revenue from the mineral lands of the United States.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_47_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_47_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[33]</a></span></p>
<p>The measures provided at your last session for the removal of certain Indian tribes have been carried into effect. Sundry treaties have been negotiated which will, in due time, be submitted for the constitutional action of the Senate. They contain stipulations for extinguishing the possessory rights of the Indians to large and valuable tracts of land. It is hoped that the effect of these treaties will result in the establishment of permanent friendly relations<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;48</span>
with such of these tribes as have been brought into frequent and bloody collision with our outlying settlements and emigrants.</p>
<p>Sound policy and our imperative duty to these wards of the government demand our anxious and constant attention to their material well-being, to their progress in the arts of civilzation, and, above all, to that moral training which, under the blessing of Divine Providence, will confer upon them the elevated and sanctifying influences, the hopes and consolation of the Christian faith.</p>
<p>I suggested in my last annual message the propriety of remodelling our Indian system. Subsequent events have satisfied me of its necessity. The details set forth in the report of the Secretary evince the urgent need for immediate legislative action.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_48_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_48_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[34]</a></span></p>
<p>I commend the benevolent institutions, established or patronized by the government in this District, to your generous and fostering care.</p>
<p>The attention of Congress, during the last session, was engaged to some extent with a proposition for enlarging the water communication between the Mississippi river and the northeastern seaboard, which proposition, however, failed for the time. Since then, upon a call of the greatest respectability a convention has been held at Chicago upon the same subject, a summary of whose views is contained in a memorial addressed to the President and Congress, and which I now have the honor to lay before you. That this interest is one which, ere long, will force its own way, I do not entertain a doubt, while it is submitted entirely to your wisdom as to what can be done now.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_48_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_48_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[35]</a></span> Augmented interest is given to this subject by the actual commencement of work upon the Pacific railroad, under auspices so favorable to rapid progress and completion. The enlarged navigation becomes a palpable need to the great road.</p>
<p>I transmit the second annual report of the Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture, asking your attention to the developments in that vital interest of the nation.</p>
<p>When<span class="ptr"><a name="7_48_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_48_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[36]</a></span> Congress assembled a year ago the war had already<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;49</span>
lasted nearly twenty months, and there had been many conflicts on both land and sea, with varying results.</p>
<p>The rebellion had been pressed back into reduced limits; yet the tone of public feeling and opinion, at home and abroad, was not satisfactory. With other signs, the popular elections, then just past, indicated uneasiness among ourselves, while amid much that was cold and menacing the kindest words coming from Europe were uttered in accents of pity, that we were too blind to surrender a hopeless cause. Our commerce was suffering greatly by a few armed vessels built upon and furnished from foreign shores, and we were threatened with such additions from the same quarter as would sweep our trade from the sea and raise our blockade. We had failed to elicit from European governments anything hopeful upon this subject. The preliminary emancipation proclamation, issued in September, was running its assigned period to the beginning of the new year. A month later the final proclamation came, including the announcement that colored men of suitable condition would be received into the war service. The policy of emancipation, and of employing black soldiers, gave to the future a new aspect, about which hope, and fear, and doubt contended in uncertain conflict. According to our political system, as a matter of civil administration, the general government had no lawful power to effect emancipation in any State, and for a long time it had been hoped that the rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a military measure. It was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it might come, and that if it should, the crisis of the contest would then be presented. It came, and as was anticipated, it was followed by dark and doubtful days. Eleven months having now passed, we are permitted to take another review. The rebel borders are pressed still further back, and by the complete opening of the Mississippi the country dominated by the rebellion is divided into distinct parts, with no practical communication between them. Tennessee and Arkansas have been substantially cleared of insurgent control, and influential citizens in each, owners of slaves and advocates of slavery at the beginning of the rebellion, now declare openly for emancipation in their respective States. Of those States not included in the emancipation proclamation, Maryland, and Missouri, neither of which three years ago would tolerate any restraint upon the extension of slavery into new territories, only dispute now as to the best mode of removing it within their own limits.</p>
<p>Of those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion, full one hundred thousand are now in the United States military service,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;50</span>
about one-half of which number actually bear arms in the ranks; thus giving the double advantage of taking so much labor from the insurgent cause, and supplying the places which otherwise must be filled with so many white men. So far as tested, it is difficult to say they are not as good soldiers as any. No servile insurrection, or tendency to violence or cruelty, has marked the measures of emancipation and arming the blacks. These measures have been much discussed in foreign countries, and contemporary with such discussion the tone of public sentiment there is much improved.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_50_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_50_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[37]</a></span> At home the same measures have been fully discussed, supported, criticised, and denounced, and the annual elections following are highly encouraging to those whose official duty it is to bear the country through this great trial. Thus we have the new reckoning. The crisis which threatened to divide the friends of the Union is past.</p>
<p>Looking now to the present and future, and with reference to a resumption of the national authority within the States wherein that authority has been suspended, I have thought fit to issue a proclamation, a copy of which is herewith transmitted.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_50_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_50_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[38]</a></span> On examination of this proclamation it will appear, as is believed, that nothing is attempted beyond what is amply justified by the Constitution. True, the form of an oath is given, but no man is coerced to take it. The man is only promised a pardon in case he voluntarily takes the oath. The Constitution authorizes the Executive to grant or withhold the pardon at his own absolute discretion; and this includes the power to grant on terms, as is fully established by judicial and other authorities.</p>
<p>It is also proffered that if, in any of the States named, a State government shall be, in the mode prescribed, set up, such government shall be recognized and guarantied by the United States, and that under it the State shall, on the constitutional conditions, be protected against invasion and domestic violence. The constitutional obligation of the United States to guaranty to every State in the Union a republican form of government, and to protect the State, in the cases stated, is explicit and full. But why tender the benefits of this provision only to a State government set up in this particular way? This section of the Constitution contemplates a case wherein the element within a State, favorable to republican<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;51</span>
government, in the Union, may be too feeble for an opposite and hostile element external to, or even within the State; and such are precisely the cases with which we are now dealing.</p>
<p>An attempt to guaranty and protect a revived State government, constructed in whole, or in preponderating part, from the very element against whose hostility and violence it is to be protected, is simply absurd. There must be a test by which to separate the opposing elements, so as to build only from the sound; and that test is a sufficiently liberal one, which accepts as sound whoever will make a sworn recantation of his former unsoundness.</p>
<p>But if it be proper to require, as a test of admission to the political body, an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United States, and to the Union under it, why also to the laws and proclamations in regard to slavery? Those laws and proclamations were enacted and put forth for the purpose of aiding in the suppression of the rebellion. To give them their fullest effect, there had to be a pledge for their maintenance. In my judgment they have aided, and will further aid, the cause for which they were intended. To now abandon them would be not only to relinquish a lever of power, but would also be a cruel and an astounding breach of faith. I<span class="ptr"><a name="7_51_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_51_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[39]</a></span> may add at this point, that while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation; nor shall I return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation, or by any of the acts of Congress. For these and other reasons it is thought best that support of these measures shall be included in the oath; and it is believed the Executive may lawfully claim it in return for pardon and restoration of forfeited rights, which he has clear constitutional power to withhold altogether, or grant upon the terms which he shall deem wisest for the public interest. It should be observed, also, that this part of the oath is subject to the modifying and abrogating power of legislation and supreme judicial decision.</p>
<p>The proposed acquiescence of the national Executive in any reasonable temporary State arrangement for the freed people is made with the view of possibly modifying the confusion and destitution which must, at best, attend all classes by a total revolution of labor throughout whole States. It is hoped that the already deeply afflicted people in those States may be somewhat more ready to give up the cause of their affliction, if, to this extent, this vital matter be left to themselves; while no power of the national Executive to prevent an abuse is abridged by the proposition.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;52</span>The<span class="ptr"><a name="7_52_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_52_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[40]</a></span> suggestion in the proclamation as to maintaining the political framework of the States on what is called reconstruction, is made in the hope that it may do good without danger of harm. It will save labor and avoid great confusion.</p>
<p>But why any proclamation now upon this subject? This question is beset with the conflicting views that the step might be delayed too long or be taken too soon. In some States the elements for resumption seem ready for action, but remain inactive, apparently for want of a rallying point---a plan of action. Why shall A adopt the plan of B, rather than B that of A? And if A and B should agree, how can they know but that the general government here will reject their plan? By the proclamation a plan is presented which may be accepted by them as a rallying point, and which they are assured in advance will not be rejected here. This may bring them to act sooner than they otherwise would.</p>
<p>The objections to a premature presentation of a plan by the national Executive consists in the danger of committals on points which could be more safely left to further developments. Care has been taken to so shape the document as to avoid embarrassments from this source. Saying that, on certain terms, certain classes will be pardoned, with rights restored, it is not said that other classes, or other terms, will never be included. Saying that reconstruction will be accepted if presented in a specified way, it is not said it will never be accepted in any other way.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_52_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_52_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[41]</a></span></p>
<p>The movements, by State action, for emancipation in several of the States, not included in the emancipation proclamation, are matters of profound gratulation. And while I do not repeat in detail what I have hertofore so earnestly urged upon this subject, my general views and feelings remain unchanged; and I trust that Congress will omit no fair opportunity of aiding these important steps to a great consummation.</p>
<p>In the midst of other cares, however important, we must not lose sight of the fact that the war power is still our main reliance. To that power alone can we look, yet for a time, to give confidence<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;53</span>
to the people in the contested regions, that the insurgent power will not again overrun them. Until that confidence shall be established, little can be done anywhere for what is called reconstruction. Hence our chiefest care must still be directed to the army and navy, who have thus far borne their harder part so nobly and well. And it may be esteemed fortunate that in giving the greatest efficiency to these indispensable arms, we do also honorably recognize the gallant men, from commander to sentinel, who compose them, and to whom, more than to others, the world must stand indebted for the home of freedom disenthralled, regenerated, enlarged, and perpetuated.

The improvements which have been made in naval architecture and naval armament, and the services which the new class of vessels have already rendered and are destined hereafter to perform are among the marked events which have their origin in the exigencies of the war and the necessities of the times. Other governments have been making large expenditures for years in experiments with a view to attain naval supremacy, but the condition of the country and the emergencies of the period have stimulated the inventive genius of our countrymen into great activity, and the Navy Department, successfully availing itself of what was useful, has applied with effect the novel principles which modern inventions and improvements have developed.''</p>

From the protection and assistance extended to them by governments which recognised the insurgents as belligerents and equals, and entitled to all the privilieges of the public national vessels of the United States, these predatory rovers have as yet escaped our cruisers, and are capturing and destroying our merchant vessels upon the high seas without sending them in to any port for adjudication. The general policy of nations in the interest of peace and the moral sentiment of mankind are averse to such lawless proceedings. Governments seem disposed to discountenance the conduct of those who, without a country or port to which they can resort, are depredating on the peaceful commerce of a country with which those governments are in amity. The action recently taken by them indicates a determination to permit no armed vessel with hostile preparation and purpose against our commerce and people to go forth from their shores. These manifestations have, I trust, tranquilized whatever excitement may have at any time existed.''</p>

The question whether these States have continued to be States in the Union, or have become territories, out of it, seems to me, in every present aspect, to be of no practical importance.

<p>Whereas, in and by the Constitution of the United States, it is provided that the President ``shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment;'' and</p>
<p>Whereas a rebellion now exists whereby the loyal State governments of several States have for a long time been subverted, and<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;54</span>
many persons have committed and are now guilty of treason against the United States; and</p>
<p>Whereas, with reference to said rebellion and treason, laws have been enacted by Congress declaring forfeitures and confiscation of property and liberation of slaves, all upon terms and conditions therein stated, and also declaring that the President was thereby authorized at any time thereafter, by proclamation, to extend to persons who may have participated in the existing rebellion, in any State or part thereof, pardon and amnesty, with such exceptions and at such times and on such conditions as he may deem expedient for the public welfare; and</p>
<p>Whereas the congressional declaration for limited and conditional pardon accords with well-established judicial exposition of the pardoning power; and</p>
<p>Whereas, with reference to said rebellion, the President of the United States has issued several proclamations, with provisions in regard to the liberation of slaves; and</p>
<p>Whereas it is now desired by some persons heretofore engaged in said rebellion to resume their allegiance to the United States, and to reinaugurate loyal State governments within and for their respective States; therefore,</p>
<p>I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do proclaim, declare, and make known to all persons who have, directly or by implication, participated in the existing rebellion, except as hereinafter excepted, that a full pardon is hereby granted to them and each of them, with restoration of all rights of property, except as to slaves, and in property cases where rights of third parties shall have intervened, and upon the condition that every such person shall take and subscribe an oath, and thenceforward keep and maintain said oath inviolate; and which oath shall be registered for permanent preservation, and shall be of the tenor and effect following, to wit:</p>
<p>``I, ---, do solemnly swear, in presence of Almighty God, that I will henceforth faithfully support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and the union of the States thereunder; and that I will, in like manner, abide by and faithfully support all acts of Congress passed during the existing rebellion with reference to slaves, so long and so far as not repealed, modified or held void by Congress, or by decision of the Supreme Court; and that I will, in like manner, abide by and faithfully support all proclamations of the President made during the existing rebellion having reference to slaves, so long and so far as not modified or declared void by decision of the Supreme Court.

<p>And I do further proclaim, declare, and make known, that whenever, in any of the States of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina, a number of persons, not less than one-tenth in number of the votes cast in such State at the Presidential election of the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty, each having taken the oath aforesaid and not having since violated it, and being a qualified voter by the election law of the State existing immediately before the so-called act of secession, and excluding all others, shall re-establish a State government which shall be republican, and in no wise contravening said oath, such shall be recognized as the true government of the State, and the State shall receive thereunder the benefits of the constitutional provision which declares that ``The United States shall guaranty to every State in this union a republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against invasion; and, on application of the legislature, or the executive, (when the legislature cannot be convened,) against domestic violence.''</p>
<p>And I do further proclaim, declare, and make known that any provision which may be adopted by such State government in relation to the freed people of such State, which shall recognize and declare their permanent freedom, provide for their education, and which may yet be consistent, as a temporary arrangement, with their present condition as a laboring, landless, and homeless class, will not be objected to by the national Executive.

as not improper, that, in constructing a loyal State government in any State, the name of the State, the boundary, the subdivisions, the constitution, and the general code of laws, as before the rebellion, be maintained, subject only to the modifications made necessary by the conditions hereinbefore stated, and such others, if any, not contravening said conditions, and which may be deemed expedient by those framing the new State government.</p>
<p>To avoid misunderstanding, it may be proper to say that this proclamation, so far as it relates to State governments, has no reference to States wherein loyal State governments have all the while been maintained. And for the same reason, it may be proper to further say that whether members sent to Congress from any State shall be admitted to seats, constitutionally rests exclusively with the respective Houses, and not to any extent with the Executive. And still further, that this proclamation is intended to present the people of the States wherein the national authority has been suspended, and loyal State governments have been subverted, a mode in and by which the national authority and loyal State governments may be re-established within said States, or in any of them; and, while the mode presented is the best the Executive can suggest, with his present impressions, it must not be understood that no other possible mode would be acceptable.</p>

<p>My dear Sir I have to urge my illness and the preparation of the Message in excuse for not having sooner transmitted you the inclosed from the Secretary of War and Provost Marshal-General in response to yours in relation to recruiting in Pennsylvania.

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADfS, DLC-RTL. On November 24 Governor Curtin had written that it had become evident the draft could not be successful and had suggested a plan for raising volunteers through state authorities. Lincoln referred the letter to the War Department, and on December 1 James B. Fry returned it with a letter accepting Curtin's suggestions in part, which Lincoln enclosed to Curtin on December 9. Curtin's reply of December 10 was in part as follows: ``I would . . . observe that the delay of your reply to my letter (the cause of which I sincerely regret) has brought us so near to the 5th of January that I much fear that little can be done in raising volunteers if the new draft is to be then gone on with. . . .''

<div class="opener">Dr. Thomas Cottman Executive Mansion,<br>
My Dear Sir Washington, December 15, 1863.</div>
<p>You were so kind as to say this morning that you desire to return to Louisiana, and to be guided by my wishes, to some extent, in the part you may take in bringing that state to resume her rightful relation to the general government.</p>
<p>My wishes are in a general way expressed as well as I can express them, in the Proclamation issued on the 8th of the present month, and in that part of the annual message which relates to that proclamation. It there appears that I deem the sustaining of the emancipation proclamation, where it applies, as indispensable; and I add here that I would esteem it fortunate, if the people of Louisiana should themselves place the remainder of the state upon the same footing, and then, if in their discretion it should appear best, make some temporary provision for the whole of the freed people, substantially as suggested in the last proclamation. I have not put forth the plan in that proclamation, as a Procrustean bed, to which exact conformity is to be indispensable; and in Louisiana particularly, I wish that labor already done, which varies from that plan in no important particular, may not be thrown away.</p>
<p>The strongest wish I have, not already publicly expressed, is that in Louisiana and elsewhere, all sincere Union men would stoutly eschew cliqueism, and, each yielding something in minor matters, all work together. Nothing is likely to be so baleful in the great work before us, as stepping aside of the main object to consider who will get the offices if a small matter shall go thus, and who else will<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;67</span>
get them, if it shall go otherwise. It is a time now for real patriots to rise above all this. As to the particulars of what I may think best to be done in any state, I have publicly stated certain points, which I have thought indispensable to the reestablishment and maintenance of the national authority; and I go no further than this because I wish to avoid both the substance and the appearance of dictation.</p>

<p>By the President of the United States of America:</p>
<p>A Proclamation.</p>
<p>Whereas, by an act of the Congress of the United States of the 24th. of May, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight, entitled ``An Act in addition to an act entitled `An act concerning discriminating duties of Tonnage and Impost' and to equalize the duties on Prussian vessels and their cargoes,'' it is provided that, upon satisfactory evidence being given to the President of the United States, by the government of any foreign nation, that no discriminating duties of tonnage or impost are imposed or levied in the ports of the said nation, upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, or upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise, imported in the same from the United States, or from any foreign country, the President is thereby authorized to issue his proclamation, declaring that the foreign discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued, so far as respects the vessels of the said foreign nation, and the produce, manufactures or merchandise, imported into the United States in the same from the said foreign nation, or from any other foreign country; the said suspension to take effect from the time of such notification being given to the President of the United States, and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels, belonging to citizens of the United States, and their cargoes, as aforesaid, shall be continued, and no longer.</p>
<p>And whereas, satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me, through an official communication of Senor Don Luis Molina, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotent ary of the Republic of Nicaragua, under date of the 28th. of November, 1863, that no other or higher duties of tonnage and impost have been imposed or levied since the second day of August, 1838, in the ports of Nicaragua upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, and upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandize imported in the same from the United States, and from any foreign<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;73</span>
country whatever, than are levied on Nicaraguan ships and their cargoes, in the same ports under like circumstances:</p>
<p>Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America, do hereby declare and proclaim, that so much of the several acts imposing discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued, so far as respects the vessels of Nicaragua, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise, imported into the United States in the same, from the dominions of Nicaragua, and from any other foreign country whatever, the said suspension to take effect from the day above mentioned, and to continue thenceforward, so long as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of the United States, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise imported into the dominions of Nicaragua, in the same as aforesaid, shall be continued on the part of the government of Nicaragua.</p>

<p>Given under my hand, at the city of Washington, the sixteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and the eighty-eighth of the Independence of the United States.</p>

<p>The application filed by you in behalf of Samuel K. Boyd, to be a Captain in the regular Army has been received, and referred to the War Department. You may not be aware that the application is directly in the teeth of a rule which we have felt constrained to adopt. Suppose your relative were now a First Lieut. in the regular Army, and the Captaincy directly above him were vacant, he would be entitled to be promoted to that vacancy. But suppose I should say to him ``Stand back sir; I want that place for outsider'' what would you and he think of it?

My dear Sir Washington, Dec. 18. 1863.</div>
<p>I believe Gen. Schofield must be relieved from command of the Department of Missouri, otherwise a question of veracity, in relation to his declarations as to his interfering, or not, with the Missouri Legislature, will be made with him, which will create an additional amount of trouble, not to be overcome by even a correct decision of the question. The question itself must be avoided. Now for the mode. Senator Henderson, his friend, thinks he can be induced to ask to be relieved, if he shall understand he will be generously treated; and, on this latter point, Gratz Brown will help his nomination, as a Major General, through the Senate. In no other way can he be confirmed; and upon his rejection alone, it would be difficult for me to sustain him as Commander of the Department. Besides, his being relieved from command of the Department, and at the same time confirmed as a Major General, will be the means of Henderson and Brown leading off together as friends, and will go far to heal the Missouri difficulty.</p>
<p>Another point. I find it is scarcely less than indispensable for me to do something for Gen. Rosecrans; and I find Henderson and Brown will agree to him for the commander of their Department.</p>
<p>Again, I have received such evidence and explanations, in regard to the supposed cotten transactions of Gen. Curtis, as fully restores in my mind the fair presumption of his innocence; and, as he is my friend, and, what is more, as I think, the countries friend, I would be glad to relieve him from the impression that I think him dishonest, by giving him a command. Most of the Iowa and Kansas delegations, a large part of that of Missouri, and the delegates from Nebraska, and Colorado, ask this in behalf of Gen. C. and suggest Kansas and other contiguous territory West of Missouri, as a Department for him.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;79</span>In a purely military point of view it may be that none of these things is indispensable, or perhaps, advantageous; but in another aspect, scarcely less important, they would give great relief, while, at the worst, I think they could not injure the military service much. I therefore shall be greatly obliged if yourself and Gen. Halleck can give me your hearty co-operation, in making the arrangement. Perhaps the first thing would be to send Gen. Schofield's nomination to me. Let me hear from you before you take any actual step in the matter. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN</p>

Schofield's reply was that he would not consent to the election of Gratz Brown.</p>
<p>``Again when Gratz Brown was about coming to Washington he sent a friend to Schofield to say that he would not oppose his confirmation if he (S.) would so far as his influence extended, agree to a convention of Missouri to make necessary alterations in her State constitution.

<div class="opener">O. D. Filley Executive Mansion,<br>
St. Louis, Mo. Washington, Dec. 22. 1863.</div>
<p>I have just looked over a petition signed by some three dozen citizens of St. Louis, and three accompanying letters, one by yourself, one by a Mr. Nathan Ranney, and one by a Mr. John D. Coalter, the whole relating to the Rev. Dr. McPheeters. The petition prays, in the name of justice and mercy that I will restore Dr. McPheeters to all his ecclesiastical rights.</p>
<p>This gives no intimation as to what ecclesiastical rights are withheld. Your letter states that Provost Marshal Dick, about a year ago, ordered the arrest of Dr. McPheters, Pastor of the Vine Street Church, prohibited him from officiating, and placed the management of the affairs of the church out of the control of it's chosen Trustees; and near the close you state that a certain course ``would insure his release.'' Mr. Ranney's letter says ``Dr. Saml. S. McPheeters is enjoying all the rights of a civilian, but can not preach the gospel!!!'' Mr. Coalter, in his letter, asks ``Is it not a strange illustration of the condition of things that the question of who shall be allowed to preach in a church in St. Louis, shall be decided by the <span class="rend-i">President</span> of <span class="rend-i">the United States?</span>''</p>
<p>Now, all this sounds very strangely; and withal, a little as if you gentlemen making the application, do not understand the case alike, one affirming that the Dr. is enjoying all the rights of a civilian, and another pointing out to me what will secure his <span class="rend-i">release</span>! On the 2nd. day of January last I wrote Gen. Curtis in relation to Mr. Dick's order upon Dr. McPheeters, and, as I suppose the Dr. is enjoying all the rights of a civilian, I only quote that part of my letter which relates to the church. It is as follows: ``But I must add that the U.S. government must not, as by this order, undertake to run the churches. When an individual, in a church or out of it, becomes dangerous to the public interest, he must be checked; but the churches, as such must take care of themselves. It will not do for the U.S. to appoint Trustees, Supervisors, or other agents for the churches.'' This letter going to Gen. Curtis,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;86</span>
then in command there I supposed of course it was obeyed, especially as I heard no further complaint from Dr. M. or his friends for nearly an entire year.</p>
<p>I have never interfered, nor thought of interfering as to who shall or shall not preach in any church; nor have I knowingly, or believingly, tolerated any one else to so interfere by my authority. If any one is so interfering, by color of my authority, I would like to have it specifically made known to me.</p>
<p>If, after all, what is now sought, is to have me put Dr. M. back, over the heads of a majority of his own congregation, that too, will be declined. I will not have control of any church on any side. Yours Respectfully A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>The assumptions of this paper, so far as I know, or believe are entirely false. I have never deprived Dr. McPheters of any ecclesiastical right, or authorized, or excused its' being done by any one deriving authority from me. On the contrary, in regard to this very case, I directed, a long time ago, that Dr. McPheters was to be arrested, or remain at large, upon the same rule as any one else; and that, in no event, was any one to interfere by my authority, as to who should, or should not preach in any church. This was done, I think, in a letter, in the nature of an order, to Mr. Dick. The assumption that I am keeping Dr. M. from preaching in his church is monstrous. If any one is doing this, by pretense of my authority, I will thank any one who can, to make out and present me, a specific case against him. If, after all, the Dr. is kept out by the majority of his own parishioners, and my official power is sought to force him in over their heads, I decline that also.</p>

<div class="opener">Executive Mansion,<br>
Major General Banks Washington, December 24. 1863.</div>
<p>Yours of the 6th. Inst. has been received, and fully considered. I deeply regret to have said or done anything which could give you pain, or uneasiness. I have all the while intended you to be <span class="rend-i">master</span>, as well in regard to re-organizing a State government for Louisiana, as in regard to the military matters of the Department; and hence my letters on reconstruction have nearly if not quite all been addressed to you. My error has been that it did not occur to me that Gov. Shepley or any one else would set up a claim to act independently of you; and hence I said nothing expressly upon the point. Language has not been guarded at a point where no danger was thought of. I now tell you that in every dispute, with whomsoever, you are master. Gov. Shepley was appointed to <span class="rend-i">assist</span> the</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;90</span>Commander of the Department, and not to thwart him, or act independently of him. Instructions have been given directly to him, merely to spare you detail labor, and not to supersede your authority. This, in it's liability to be misconstrued, it now seems was an error in us. But it is past. I now distinctly tell you that you are master of all, and that I wish you to take the case as you find it, and give us a free-state re-organization of Louisiana, in the shortest possible time. What I say here is to have a reasonable construction. I do not mean that you are to withdraw from Texas, or abandon any other military measure which you may deem important. Nor do I mean that you are to throw away available work already done for re-construction; or that war is to be made upon Gov. Shepley, or upon any one else, unless it be found that they will not co-operate with you, in which case, and in all cases, you are master while you remain in command of the Department.</p>
<p>My thanks for your successful and valuable operations in Texas. Yours as ever A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS, IHi. General Banks wrote on December 6, 1863:</p>
<p>``Your letter dated Nov. 5th. relating to the organization of Government in Louisiana, I recd. upon my return from Texas Dec. 2d. Your letter of the 5th. August, upon the same subject, was also duly received, and answered. My reply expressed a cordial concurrence in your views, and an earnest desire to co-operate in their execution. From the first I have regarded reorganization of government here as of the highest importance, and I have never failed to advocate every where the earliest development of this interest by congressional elections and by initiatory measures for state, organization. . . . In the initial reconstruction, the basis should be that of a free state beyond the possibility of failure. Having secured this other states, will easily follow. . . . So strong has been my conviction on this subject that I requested Governor Boutwell to press upon your attention my views---when I returned from the Teche Country in October. . . . I addressed to you a lengthy letter, and also wrote to Governor Shepley, and to Mr. Durant, Attorney General and other gentlemen, urging the completion of this duty by the quickest methods: but I found most of these gentlemen so interested in topics, that seemed to me disconnected with the general subject, and so slightly disposed to encourage my participation in the affair that I retained the letter I had written, and turned my attention, not unwillingly, to matters more likely to be accomplished, though not more important. The restoration of our Flag in Texas from Ringold Barracks on the Rio Grande to the Brasos on the coast, rewarded my change of purpose.</p>
<p>``You will judge my surprise, leniently, I hope, when I learned by your letter of the 5th. of Nov. that you attached responsibility to my actions in regard to the execution of your wishes. I assure you it is not so understood here. I do not so understand it. All the officers of the government are officially informed, that it has been committed by special instructions from Washington, to Governor Shepley. When the crazy project of an unauthorized election in November was made known, upon the rumor that I had given it my countenance and my approval Governor Shepley and Honorable Mr Durant both notified me by official letters, that the subject of an election or state organization had been exclusively committed to him, the military Governor. I so understood it myself. I have had neither authority, influence, or recognition as an officer entrusted with this duty. My suggestions are respectfully, but silently received by the Governor and his<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;91</span>
associates. In that I supposed they were right. How then can I be in any just sense responsible for the result? I beg your just consideration of these facts! Since I received your letter---the reply to which is made with extreme solicitude---I have recurred to my orders from your government. . . . Had the organization of a <span class="rend-i">free</span> state in Louisiana been committed to me under general instructions only, it would have been complete before this day. It can be effected now in sixty days---let me say, even in <span class="rend-i">thirty</span> days, if necessary. . . . But it should be undertaken only by those who have authority to act: who know what to do, who have no personal interests in addition or superior to the creation of a FREE STATE, and who can harmonize the action of individuals without the sacrifice of public interest. I do not suppose I have the qualifications for this duty; certain I am that I have not the authority. How then can I be held responsible for the failure to satisfy your expectations?. . .''</p>

<p>``I have just received your Christmas suggestion, and with all the more pleasure because I think quite as you do with regard to the interest and importance of the subject you propose. I intended, at first, to devote a part of my present lecture to Russian serfdom and its abolishment, but found that it would make my discourse altogether too long. I therefore decided to give, first of all, a general account of Russia and the people, concerning which I had many things to say which are not only new to our people, but advantageous for them to know. My own short experience has satisfied me that no country (except, perhaps, our own) has been as misrepresented as Russia.</p>
<p>``It is rather late, this winter, to prepare a new lecture, especially as I have engaged to deliver that on `Russia and Her People' in some thirty different cities; but I fully understand the interest of the subject you propose, and desire to present it, in some way, to the public. There are only slight resemblances between Russian serfdom and slavery in the southern states, although they rest on the same basis---property in Man---but the complete success of the scheme of emancipation in Russia has much significance for this nation at the present time.</p>

<p>1. You will allow any loyal person of twenty one years of age, or upwards, who has at any time since the occupation by the national forces resided for six months, or now resides upon, or is<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;99</span>
engaged in cultivating any lands in your district owned by the United States to enter the same for preemption to the extent of one, or at the option of the preemptor, two tracts of twenty acres each, paying therefor one dollar and twenty five cents per acre. You will give preference in all cases to heads of families, and married women whose husbands are engaged in the service of the United States, or are necessarily absent.</p>
<p>2. You will permit each soldier, sailor or marine actually engaged in the service of the United States, or any who may have been, or hereafter shall be honorably discharged to preempt and purchase in person, or by authorized agents, at the rate of one dollar, twenty five cents per acre, one tract of twenty acres of land, if single and, if married, two tracts of twenty acres each, in addition to the amount, a head of family, or married woman in the absence of her husband, is allowed to preempt and purchase under the general privilege to loyal persons.</p>
<p>3. Each preemptor on filling his claim and receiving a certificate of preemption must pay in United States notes, two fifths of the price, and the residue on receiving a deed for the parcels of land preempted, and a failure to make complete payment on receipt of the Deed will forfeit all rights under the preemption, as well as all partial payments for the land.</p>
<p>4. When persons authorized to purchase by preemption desire to enter upon, and cultivate lands not yet surveyed, they may do so, but they will be required to conform in their selection, as nearly as possible, to the probable lines of the surveys, and to take and occupy them subject to correction of title and occupation by actual surveys when made.</p>
<p>5. In making surveys, such reservations for paths and roadways will be made as will allow easy and convenient access to the several subdivisions entered for sale and occupancy by preemption or otherwise. Approved December 31. 1863.</p>

<p>You desire to know, in the event of our complete success in the field, the same being followed by a loyal and cheerful submission on the part of the South, if universal amnesty should not be accompanied with universal suffrage.</p>
<p>Now, since you know my private inclinations as to what terms should be granted to the South in the contingency mentioned, I will here add, that if our success should thus be realized, followed by such desired results, I cannot see, if universal amnesty is granted, how, under the circumstances, I can avoid exacting in return universal suffrage, or, at least, suffrage on the basis of intelligence and military service.</p>
<p>How to better the condition of the colored race has long been a study which has attracted my serious and careful attention; hence I think I am clear and decided as to what course I shall pursue in the premises, regarding it a religious duty, as the nation's guardian of these people, who have so heroically vindicated their manhood on the battle-field, where, in assisting to save the life of the Republic, they have demonstrated in blood their right to the ballot, which is but the humane protection of the flag they have so fearlessly defended.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; New York <span class="rend-i">Tribune</span>, September 26, 1865; <span class="rend-i">Scribner's Magazine</span>, January, 1893. This extract was widely reprinted in newspapers from the source indicated in the <span class="rend-i">Tribune</span> as follows:</p>
<p>``<span class="rend-i">The Southern Advocate</span> of the 18th inst. says:</p>
<p>``The following extract, which has just been published, is from the late President Lincoln's letter to Gen. Wadsworth, who fell in the battle of the Wilderness. The letter, which is of a private character, is to be sent to Gen. Wadsworth's family.</p>
<p>```It shows that Mr. Lincoln, who desired the bestowal of the elective franchise upon the blacks, was also, at an early day, in favor of granting universal amnesty, which, for some strange and unaccountable reason, is still withheld from the South, notwithstanding it is known that it was his intention to grant, without any exception, a general pardon.</p>
<p>```His wishes, in this particular, the American people cannot afford to disregard. Congress will, no doubt, exact the right of suffrage for the blacks. Why universal amnesty should be withheld until that time, we are unable to see. This, certainly, was not Mr. Lincoln's plan, whose intentions all parties should sacredly observe.</p>
<p>```The following is the extract referred to, in which Mr. Lincoln says: [extract as given above].'''</p>
<p><span class="rend-i">The Southern Advocate</span> has not been located, and no other reference has been found to the original letter to Wadsworth. The contents of the excerpt is, however, closely in keeping with views expressed by Lincoln elsewhere (see Fragment, August 26, 1863, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>), and seems to be genuine. The date assigned is based upon the fact that General Wadsworth returned from his tour of inspection of freedmen in the Mississippi Valley on December 3, 1863, and on the supposition that Lincoln's letter would probably have been written some time thereafter, but in any case prior to May, 1864, since Wadsworth was killed in the Battle of the Wilderness, May 5-7, 1864.</p>

<p>``After great labor the volunteer recruiting service under the President's call of October 17th is fairly in progress. Letters all dated between the 20th &amp; 24th of December from the Superintendents of Recruiting Service in Sixteen states are in the main very encouraging as to the prospect of getting a large number of recruits by volunteer enlistments. Several of the states were in a fair way to raise the quotas assigned them. The Act approved December 23d. 1863, forbidding after January 5th the payment to volunteers of all bounties except $100 authorized by the Act of 1861 was not known at the time these favorable reports were made to me. I have no doubt the effect of that act will be to check if it does not stop enlistments. Of the $100 bounty provided by Act of 1861 but $25 can be paid in advance, $75 being due only after two years service.</p>
<p>``It took some time after October 17th to get the people aroused to the subject of volunteering; they are now in most states earnestly engaged in it, &amp; I have reports for October, November &amp; part of December showing that 42,529 men have been enlisted, &amp; the daily average of enlistments in increasing.

to the merits of the system of raising troops by volunteers and the payment of bounties, and the system of raising an adequate force by draft, yet two things are certain---</p>
<p>``First---That, whatever may be the weight of argument or the influence of individual opinion, a large portion of the people . . . prefer the method of contributing their proportion of the military force by bounty to volunteers rather than by draft.</p>
<p>``Second---that veteran soldiers who have become inured to service, even when paid bounty, constitute a cheaper force than raw recruits or drafted men without bounty.</p>
<p>``The information received by this Department from the armies in the field, prior to the passage of the resolution . . . indicated that a very large proportion of the forces now in service would have cheerfully re-enlisted for three years under the terms authorized by the order of this Department, and that such enlistments have been checked, and will in great measure be put an end to, by the restriction imposed by the act of Congress. It is believed that if any limitation should be imposed upon the payment of bounties to encourage the enlistment of the veteran forces now in the field, it ought not to be sooner than the 1st of February. It is respectfully submitted to your consideration, therefore, whether the attention of Congress might not again well be called to the subject, so that the resolution may be reconsidered.''</p>
<p>A joint resolution approved January 13, 1864, extended the payment of bounties until March 1, and the joint resolution approved March 3, provided further extension to April 1, 1864.</p>

Flanders, ``provided the holders of the Bonds shall deposit fifty per centum thereof with the Treasurer of the United States until the close of the war:''</p>
<p>``The undersigned are advised that a large number of persons are within the Rebel lines who have cotton---sugar and other stores---which they have been and are concealing from the Rebel authorities as confiscable property. That these parties are anxious to place these supplies within the United States Military lines---not only as a place of safety, but to secure for their families a means of support and a means of satisfying their debts to Loyal Union citizens. Many of these parties desire to leave the so-called Confederacy so soon as they can place their property on which they depend---on a place of safety.</p>
<p>``They do not ask to have the proceeds of their property returned in supplies---but are willing to invest the net proceeds---less the current Government dues and the expenses attending the getting to market and selling---in United States Bonds.</p>
<p>``They have designated George B. Waldron of New York---Crafts J. Wright of Cincinnati and Charles K. Hawkes of New York as Loyal Union citizens to whom they will consign their property and who shall invest the proceeds as above---and in whom they and the Government can confide. . . .</p>
<p>``We therefore urgently recommend that the authority be given to the above named . . . to receive from within the Rebel lines at such points as may be designated---such cotton sugar, and other stores, as it may be desired to convey within the United States Military lines for sale---and to invest the proceeds---less the expenses---in Government securities, that protection be afforded by the military and naval authorities---unless there be imperative military objections at the time.'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>.).</p>
<p>On January 8, Wright and Hawkes replied to Lincoln's questions:</p>
<p>``Before proceeding to reply specifically to the several questions which you have put to us, we deem it proper, to a better understanding of the difficulties now in the way of the increase of Union people &amp; the protection of Union property, to make, with your permission, a preliminary observation statement. . . .</p>
<p>[Question 1:]</p>
<p>``1st. If he has not <span class="rend-i">previously</span> bribed the pickets, they would siese and confiscate it. . . .</p>
<p>``2d. Not having a permit previously obtained it would be, by officers of the Treasury Dept, at once seised &amp; confiscated. . . .</p>
<p>``3d. The <span class="rend-i">Rebel</span> would be seperated from his property---arrested---&amp; confined,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;116</span>
until he took the oath and <span class="rend-i">satisfied</span> the officer . . . to `keep and maintain' said oath. . . .</p>
<p>``4th. Admitting that after detention . . . he takes the oath . . . gets his property released . . . yet, ignorant of forms . . . must assuredly fall into the hands of Jews . . .</p>
<p>``5th. Cotton is a heavy article to be transported. . . . If the Rebel came to our lines, <span class="rend-i">he could</span> bring only <span class="rend-i">one</span> load; to secure that load, he must take the <span class="rend-i">oath</span>. He cannot get back to rebel lines for other loads.</p>
<p>[Question 2:]</p>
<p>``1st. We have removed all the danger of confiscation &amp; difficulties on <span class="rend-i">our side of the lines. . . . </span></p>
<p>``2d. We give him such assurance &amp; present to him, a <span class="rend-i">working plan</span>, clear &amp; distinct, which <span class="rend-i">induces</span> effort to. . . .</p>
<p>[Question 3:]</p>
<p>``. . . . We answer in New Orleans---Cincinnati---St. Louis, the great cotton markets. We propose only to sell it, at public auction, to make ourselves free of all charge of unfairness. . . . All the officers of the Treasury Department . . . vouch for us, by their recommendations which we present. . . . The <span class="rend-i">commanding Officers</span> of the <span class="rend-i">Department of the Military Government</span>, vouch for us . . . Some of us have shewn our faith in battle fields . . . We recommend that the collector of customs have a supervision over . . . affairs . . . The permit granted, if it is found we do not keep faith, or the method works badly, . . . will . . . be revokable at pleasure . . . Our <span class="rend-i">interest</span> will induce Faith. . . We are merchants and make our own arrangements as such---our fees &amp; commissions are regulated by the customs of trade, long established in New Orleans, governing all transactions. . . .'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>.).</p>
<p>On January 9, Wright and Hawkes sent a supplementary reply and enclosed a suggested from of the order which they hoped the president would issue. Although some of the suggestions made by Wright and Hawkes were adopted in the new regulations issued for Treasury Agents (see Order of January 26, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>), no special arrangement with the gentlemen concerned seems to have been made. Efforts on the part of George Ashmun to have Hawkes appointed agent of the Treasury also failed (Ashmun to Lincoln, January 20 and February 2, 1864, DLC-RTL).</p>

<p>I have received two letters from you which are duplicates, each of the other, except that one bears date the 27th and the other the 30th of December. Your confidence in the practicability of constructing a free state-government, speedily, for Louisiana, and<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;124</span>

I am much in hope that, on the authority of my letter, of December 24th. you have already begun the work. Whether you shall have done so or not, please, on receiving this, proceed with all possible despatch, using your own absolute discretion in all matters which may not carry you away from the conditions stated in your letters to me, nor from those of the Message and Proclamation of December 8th. Frame orders, and fix times and places, for this, and that, according to your own judgement.</p>
<p>I am much gratified to know that Mr. Dennison, the Collector at New-Orleans, and who bears you this, understands your views, and will give you his full, and zealous co-operation. It is my wish, and purpose, that all others, holding authority from me, shall do the like; and, to spare me writing, I will thank you to make this known to them. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS, IHi; ADfS, DLC-RTL. Bank's letter of December 27 has not been located, but that of December 30 is as follows:</p>
<p>``Your message and proclamation can not fail to produce great national results.They offer an escape to many classes of people in the South, who will not fail to yield their assent to the conditions imposed. . . .</p>
<p>``Much reflection, and frank conversation with many persons who know the southern character, thoroughly confirm me in the opinion. I expressed in my recent letters, that the immediate restoration of a State government upon the basis of an absolute extinction of slavery at the start, with the general consent of the people, is practicable. . . . I have been greatly surprised to find how readily my conclusions have been accepted by men of strongest southern sympathies, attachments and interests.</p>
<p>``If, as you have declared in your letter of November the 5th., an early organization in this State be desirable, I would suggest as the <span class="rend-i">only speedy</span> and <span class="rend-i">certain</span> method of accomplishing your object, that an election be ordered, of a State Government, under the Constitution and Laws of Louisiana, except so much thereof as recognizes and relates to slavery, which should be declared by the authority calling the election, and in the order authorizing it, <span class="rend-i">inoperative and void</span>. The registration of voters to be made in conformity with your Proclamation. . . . A convention of the People for the Revision of the Constitution, may be ordered as soon as the government is organized, and the election of members might take place on the same, or a subsequent day, with the general election. The People of Louisiana will accept such a proposition with favor. . . .</p>
<p>``Let me assure you that this course will be far more acceptable to the citizens of Louisiana, than the submission of the question of slavery to the chances of an election. Their self-respect, their <span class="rend-i">amour propre</span> will be appeased if they are not required to vote for or against it. Offer them a Government without slavery, and they will gladly accept it as a necessity resulting from the war. . . .</p>
<p>``Upon this plan, a government can be established whenever you wish---in 30, or 60 days . . . Defeat is impossible, and the dangers attending delay, are avoided. I would unhesitatingly stake my life upon the issue.</p>
<p>``If this plan be accepted in Louisiana, . . . it will be adopted by general concurrence, in Texas, Arkansas, and Mississippi, and in every other southern<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;125</span>
state, as rapidly as you choose to accord to them the privilege of self-government. If it be accepted in one State, the World will see that only the method, but the fact of restoration is accomplished.</p>
<p>``I am opposed to any settlement, and have been from the beginning, except upon the basis of immediate emancipation, but it is better to secure it by consent, than by force, better still by consent <span class="rend-i">and</span> force. . . .</p>
<p>``I need not repeat what I have already said, that I shall cordially and earnestly sustain any plan you may adopt for the restoration of government here. It is my duty, and my desire. With very great reluctance, and sense of public duty, I have made the suggestion herein contained, upon the same principle that I would impart important military information. . . .</p>
<p>``The plan of restoration contemplated here by the officers charged with that duty, does not seem to promise results so speedy or certain. It proceeds upon the theory of constitutional convention to frame an organic law. . . . The election of delegates cannot be called before March. . . . The convention could not sit before April. It could scarcely occupy less than two months. Its action could hardly be submitted to the People. . . . before July. . . .</p>
<p>``The advantages secured by this course, will be:</p>

</div>
<a name=""></a><div class="textindentlevelx" id="">

<a name=""></a><div class="textindentlevelx" id="">
<p>It places in your hands the means of the restoration of States, as well as the destruction of armies---independent of the possible results of party or political contests.</p>
<p>``The fact of restoration is, however, more important than the means, and I shall cordially sustain any policy you may indicate.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>Banks acknowledged receipt of Lincoln's letter of December 29, 1863, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>, on January 11: ``I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th [24th]. December and a duplicate of the same with an endorsement dated the 29th. of December. They give to me all the authority I can desire. . . . Enclosed you will find an order to be published tomorrow, authorizing an election of the state officers on the 22d. of February. It does not contemplate an election of the Legislature or Judges until November at the regular election. . . . I am confident that it will receive a very general support of all classes of people, and a strength at the Polls that will surprise as well as gratify the friends of the government elsewhere. . . .''

<p>``The next day or two,. . . . Gov. Johnson issued the enclosed proclamation, in which you observe, he prescribed an oath to be taken by every citizen in order to [establish] his qualification to vote. This produced considerable confusion. . . .</p>
<p>``Now, Mr. President, what I ask of you is to state, in some form which may be made public, the necessary steps to be taken by the people of Tennessee to entitle them to the exercise of the elective franchise.</p>

<p>He stated the reason to be that the experience of the past had proved that there was constant conflict between military governors and military commanders, which was injurious to the interests under their charge. He expressed hopes that a formal organization of the State Government under the terms of the Amnesty Proclamation would speedily be made by the people of Arkansas.

<div class="opener">Alpheus Lewis, Esq. Executive Mansion,<br>
My dear Sir Washington, January 23. 1864.</div>
<p>You have enquired how the government would regard and treat cases wherein the owners of plantations, in Arkansas, for instance, might fully recognize the freedom of those formerly slaves, and by fair contracts of hire with them, re-commence the cultivation of their plantations. I answer I should regard such cases with great favor, and should, as the principle, treat them precisely as I would treat the same number of free white people in the same relation and condition. Whether white or black, reasonable effort should be made to give government protection. In neither case should the giving of aid and comfort to the rebellion, or other practices injurious to the government, be allowed on such plantations; and in either, the government would claim the right to take if necessary those of proper ages and conditions into the military service. Such plan must not be used to break up existing leases or arrangements of abandoned plantations which the government may have made to give employment and sustenance to the idle and destitute people. With the foregoing qualifications and explanations, and in view of it's tendency to advance freedom, and restore peace and prosperity, such hireing and employment of the freed people, would be regarded by me with rather especial favor. Yours truly A. LINCOLN</p>
<p>P.S. To be more specific I add that all the Military, and others acting by authority of the United States, are to favor and facilitate the introduction and carrying forward, in good faith, the free-labor system as above indicated, by allowing the necessary supplies therefor to be procured and taken to the proper points, and by doing and forbearing whatever will advance it; <span class="rend-i">provided</span> that<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;146</span>
existing military and trade regulations be not transcended thereby. I shall be glad to learn that planters adopting this system shall have employed one so zealous and active as yourself to act as an agent in relation thereto. A.L.</p>

<p>``Mr. Lewis obtained when here some time since a permit to purchase cotton. He proceeded south for that purpose but found that the planters in side of our lines refused to let him have cotton unless he would furnish a . . . proportion of supplies in lieu of the cotton purchased. These people are bound to live, must live, &amp; they can only live on supplied furnished by our people. . . . Therefore would it be improper to allow Mr. Lewis this privilege. I will stand as sponsor for him that he will not abuse this privilege, but in connexion with it, obtain more valuable information upon which the govt. can act than any man you can have to operate. . . .''

<p>REPLY OF MAJ. GEN. J. G. FOSTER, COMMANDING</p>
<p>DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO, KNOXVILLE, TENN.</p>
<p>Headquarters Confederate Forces, East Tenn.,</p>
<p>To the Commanding General U.S. Forces, East Tenn. Jan. 3, 1864.</p>
<p>Sir: I find the Proclamation of President Lincoln of the 8th of December last, in circulation in handbills among our soldiers. The immediate object of this circulation appears to be to induce our soldiers to quit our ranks and to take the oath of allegiance to the United States Government. I presume, however, that the great object and end in view is to hasten the day of peace.</p>
<p>I respectfully suggest, for your consideration, the propriety of communicating any views that your Government may have upon this subject through me, rather than by handbills circulated among our soldiers. The few men who may desert under the promise held out in the Proclamation can not be men of character or standing. If they desert their cause they degrade [disgrace] themselves in the eyes of God and of man. They can do your cause no good, nor can they injure ours.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;154</span>As a great nation, you can accept none but an honorable peace; as a noble people, you could have us accept nothing less. I submit, therefore, whether the mode that I suggest would not be more likely to lead to an honorable end than such a circulation of a partial promise of freedom [pardon].</p>
<p>I am, Sir, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,</p>
<p>J. LONGSTREET, Lieut-Gen. Commanding</p>

<p>Headquarters Department of the Ohio,</p>
<p>Knoxville, E.T.,</p>
<p>Lieut-Gen. Commanding Forces in East Tennessee: Jan. 7, 1864.</p>
<p>Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated Jan. 3, 1864: you are correct in the supposition that the great object in view in the circulation of the President's Proclamation, is to induce those now in Rebellion against the Government, to lay aside their arms, and return to their allegiance as citizens of the United States, thus securing the re-union of States now arrayed in hostility against one another and restoration of peace. The immediate effect of the circulation may be to cause many men to leave your ranks, to return home, or come within our lines, and, in view of this latter course, it has been thought proper to issue an order announcing the favorable terms on which deserters will be received.</p>
<p>I accept, however, your suggestion that it would have been more courteous to have sent these documents to you for circulation, and I embrace with pleasure the opportunity thus afforded to enclose to you twenty (20) copies of each of these documents and rely upon your generosity and desire for peace, to give publicity to the same among your officers and men.</p>

<p>``It gives me great pleasure to report the progress making in the state election. All parties participate in the selection of candidates, and a very handsome vote will be given. Not a word is heard from any one in favor of a restoration of slavery, and no objection is made to the free state basis upon which the election is based. The indications are very strong that Mr. Hahn will be elected governor. By the middle of April, you will receive a full delegation in both houses of Congress, composed not only of loyal men but earnest supporters of your administration. This will be accomplished in ninety days from the receipt of your letter embracing your instructions for a free state organization in the shortest possible time, and it will give in its results I am sure satisfaction to the People. Officers selected will be from the established residents of the state. The only part I take in the affair is to discourage nominations from the army of which none will be attempted.</p>
<p>``The only ground of hesitation on the part of the most conservative men is in regard to the oath required which is that of your proclamation of the 8th. December; Prominent Union men, who have never sympathized with or aided the rebellion directly or indirectly, . . . who support your administration, . . . have taken the oath, and complied with the conditions of your proclamation . . . say, that having been established in their rights as citizens, and voted in election of members of congress they ought not to be compelled to take an additional oath in order to vote at this election. The exception taken refers . . . to the clauses referring to the laws of congress &amp;c. relating to slavery and the confiscation of property. There is perhaps a professional interest in the case. Some of the most prominent and steadfast are lawyers of high standing. They have discussed the statutes of confiscation in the District court here and expect to argue their causes in Washington. They interpret the oath so as to forbid this exercise of their professional privileges. . . . It has seemed to me that the oath prescribed in the late proclamation was intended to apply to states in which no elections have been held, and that if it were so construed as to allow loyal men to vote who had qualified under the conditions of the Proclamation of no harm could be done. It would not change the results of the election, but affect only the aggregate of votes. . . .</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;163</span>``You will have heard of some objections to the speedy organization of the state which I have proposed.

<p>Sir: You are directed to have a transport (either a steam or sailing vessel as may be deemed proper by the Quartermaster-General) sent to the colored colony established by the United States at the island of Vache, on the coast of San Domingo, to bring back to this country such of the colonists there as desire to return. You will have the transport furnished with suitable supplies for that purpose, and detail an officer of the Quartermaster's Department who, under special instructions to be given, shall have charge of the business. The colonists will be brought to Washington, unless otherwise hereafter directed, and be employed and provided for at the camps for colored persons around that city.

<div class="opener">To His Majesty Kamehameha, V, February 2, 1864</div>
<p>King of the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>Great and Good Friend: I have read with feelings of profound sorrow your Majesty's letter of the 5th. December last announcing the death on the 30th. of the preceding month, of His Majesty, your Brother, Kamehameha IV, and conveying also the pleasing intelligence of your Majesty's constitutional succession to the Throne of the Hawaiian Kingdom.</p>
<p>Your Majesty's anticipations of sympathy from me in the double bereavement which you have experienced in the decease of your Sovereign and Brother are fully realized. Not only I, but the whole American People are deeply moved by the intelligence of the event with which God in His infinite wisdom has afflicted your Majesty and the Hawaiian nation; for whom this Government and people have ever entertained sentiments of almost paternal regard, as well as of sincere friendship and unchanging interest.</p>
<p>It is gratifying to know that His Majesty's place on the Throne and in the hearts of the Hawaiian people is occupied by one who was allied to him by the closest ties of blood, and by a long participation in the affairs of the Kingdom. These influences, controlled by the Supreme Ruler of the Universe whose guidance your Majesty invokes, and by those aspirations which your Majesty cherishes for the good of your subjects, cannot fail to assure the well-being and prosperity of the Hawaiian Kingdom.</p>
<p>Your Majesty may ever firmly rely upon my sincere sympathy and cordial support and upon the abiding friendship of the people of the United States in the execution of the lofty mission entrusted to you by Providence.</p>
<p>Commending your Majesty, and the bereaved Widow and People of the late King to the Fatherly protection and comfort of the Almighty, I remain Your Majesty's Good Friend,</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; AES, DLC-RTL. Lincoln's endorsement is written on a letter of Colonel Richard M. Edwards, Fourth Tennessee Cavalry, to Stanton, January 29, 1864, as follows:</p>
<p>``Sir: Under authority of Gov Johnson of Tennessee I have raised a Regiment of cavalry known as the 4th East Tennessee cavalry. I began the organization of the Regiment at Cumberland Gap previous to receiving a copy of the newly prescribed oath of office requiring persons to swear that they have `not sought nor accepted nor attempted to exercise the functions of any office whatever under any authority or pretended authority in hostility to the</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;170</span>United States.' As I had held the position of Representative in the state legislature of Tennessee after the so-called act of secession, it has been seriously urged by some, that the terms of the oath were intended to debar all holding state offices in a seceded state as well as those holding confederate offices. Hence desiring to be mustered in as Colonel of my Regiment, I desire a settlement of the question as to my eligibility to that position</p>
<p>``About twenty other union men served in the same legislature with me who have maintained their positions as loyal men to the present time. Some of them in fact like myself are organizing Regiments for our service, and I suppose the same question will be presented in their behalf. The question is one of very great importance to a very large portion of the loyal men of Tennessee, reaching as it does from a constable or justice of a civil district to the Judge of the supreme court. The Union men of East Tennessee, held nearly all the state offices in that section, maintaining as we all do, that the state was <span class="rend-i">not out of the Union</span>; and that only a portion of her citizens were in hostility to the Government. Nearly all those officers were forced by the Rebel authorities to take an oath `to support the confederate constitution, and the constitution of Tennessee,' a very extraordinary oath considering the constitution of Tennessee not changed according to its own provisions, which expressly provides that members of the legislature &amp; other officers shall take an oath to support the constitution of the United States. The two clauses of their oath, being inconsistent were of course void. Further there was no law of Tennessee requiring such an oath we having succeeded in defeating that measure in the legislature. The oath then was not only void on account of inconsistent terms, and in direct conflict with the provisions of our own constitution of Tennessee, but also wanting legal sanction. Yet the so called confederate Government through their military control of the state, required all civil officers as well as military to take said oath; in default of which the offender was forced off to Tuscaloosa, there to lie and sicken and die as numbers from East Tennessee have done, in a prison, the loathsomeness of which was scarce equalled by the famous Blackhole of Calcutta. Having then held a state office, in a <span class="rend-i">state not out of the Union</span> (for if out the doctrine of secession must be true which we can not agree to) and having been forced under military power to take an illegal unconstitutional, void oath, am I as well as all other state officers of Tennessee disqualified for holding a Federal office? Having raised a good Regiment many of whom voted for me for the aforesaid office, &amp; now desire me to lead them I only await a decision of the above question I am Very Respy.''</p>
<p>Charles A. Dana returned the letter to the president on February 19, 1864, with the following communication:</p>
<p>``In regard to the case of R. M. Edwards Colonel of the 4th. Tennessee Cavalry whose letter, objecting to the oath of allegiance was by you submitted to the Secretary of War on the 5th instant. . . . I am directed to say that the oath to which Colonel Edwards objects is verbally the same as that prescribed by Act of Congress approved July 2d 1862 to be taken by `every person elected or appointed to any office of honor or profit under the government of the United States, either in the civil, military or naval departments of the public service excepting the President of the United States.'

<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;171</span>New Orleans. The object of moving in this matter is to have Col. Scroggs sent by you, with his regiment, to Texas, charged to collect and organize the colored men of that State, it being believed that such a nucleus as this regiment, and such an experienced organizer of troops as Col. Scroggs has shown himself, will prove highly successful. I hope this purpose will meet with your approval, and that, by such orders as your judgment will dictate, you will put Col.

<p>``The last Session of the 36th. Congress proposed to so amend the Constitution of the U.S. as to prohibit any interference with slavery, (by the General Government) where it then existed.</p>
<p>``It was disregarded, and the slave states resorted to war to separate from the free states.</p>
<p>``Now, why not send a message to Congress recommending the passage of a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution forever prohibiting slavery in the States and territories?</p>
<p>``It would be <span class="rend-i">your</span> measure and would be passed by a two thirds vote, and, eventually, three fourths of the states, through their Legislatures, would consent to it.</p>
<p>``If not done very soon the proposition <span class="rend-i">will</span> be presented by the Democracy and claimed by them as <span class="rend-i">their</span> proposition. This may look strange to those who do not remember with what <span class="rend-i">facility</span> that party can change front.</p>
<p>``Is it not right in itself and the best way to end Slavery!</p>
<p>``It would have a beneficial influence on our election next fall.</p>
<p>``Those who deny the justice of a second term to you are attempting to<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;173</span>
weaken the faith of the people in your plan of reorganizing the state Governments of the rebel states. <span class="rend-i">They</span> say, suppose a state does so change its constitution as to prohibit slavery, why may it not, in a few years, hereafter, change back again?</p>
<p>``The proposed amendment would answer that cavil.</p>
<p>``A single amendment, thus submitted to the Legislatures of the several states, would not open the whole constitution to amendment---and no harm can come of it, even should it fail to receive the sanction of the constitutional number of states.</p>
<p>``If done, it would be in accordance with the mode provided by the constitution itself for its amendment---to which no one could reasonably object.</p>
<p>``Many reasons could be given in its favor---but I only desire to call your attention to the subject, and not to trouble you with an argument.</p>
<p>``Should you submit such a proposition I think it would be heartily endorsed by our State Convention on the 22d. inst.</p>
<p>``I think it a great <span class="rend-i">move</span> on the political chess-board.''</p>
<p>A joint resolution (S. 16), introduced by Senator John B. Henderson on January 11, 1864, was amended and passed by the Senate on April 11. In the House it failed to receive the necessary two-thirds majority until January 31, 1865. Approved by President Lincoln on February 1, 1865, the resolution was adopted by the requisite three-fourths of the states and became the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution.</p>

<p>John Schiel (Schiel, Scheel, or Schell), deceased brother-in-law of Gustave Koerner, was followed by Frederick Pieper of Belleville, Illinois, as assessor.

<div class="opener">Hon. Secretary of War Executive Mansion,<br>
My dear Sir Washington, Feb. 11, 1864.</div>
<p>In January 1863, the Provost-Marshal at St. Louis, having taken the control of a certain church from one set of men and given it to another, I wrote Gen. Curtis on the subject, as follows:</p>
<p>``the U.S. Government must not, as by this order, undertake to<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;179</span>
run the churches. When an individual, in a church or out of it, becomes dangerous to the public interest, he must be checked; but the churches, as such, must take care of themselves. It will not do for the U.S. to appoint trustees, Supervisors, or other agents for the churches.''</p>
<p>Some trouble remaining in this same case, I, on the 22nd. of Dec. 1863, in a letter to Mr. O. D. Filley, repeated the above language; and, among other things, added ``I have never interfered, nor thought of interfering as to who shall or shall not preach in any church; nor have I knowingly, or believingly, tolerated any one else to so interfere by my authority. If any one is so interfering by color of my authority, I would like to have it specifically made known to me. . . . I will not have control of any church on any side.''</p>
<p>After having made these declarations in good faith, and in writing, you can conceive of my embarrassment at now having brought to me what purports to be a formal order of the War Department, bearing date Nov. 30th. 1863, giving Bishop Ames control and possession of all the Methodist churches in certain Southern Military Departments, whose pastors have not been appointed by a loyal Bishop or Bishops, and ordering the Military to aid him against any resistance which may be made to his taking such possession and control.

<p>``On the 12th of the present month the Rev. Bishop Ames presented at these headquarters a circular letter from War Department, dated November 30, 1863, copy of which is hereto annexed, marked A, directing that--- `All houses of worship belonging to the Methodist Episcopal Church South, in which a loyal minister appointed by a loyal bishop of said church does not now officiate, are placed at the disposal of the Right Rev. Bishop Ames---' and asked that an order be issued in conformity thereto. I immediately issued a circular to commanding officers of troops of the department . . . directing that `they furnish Bishop Ames every facility and assistance compatible with the interests of the service' under the order mentioned. Saturday, Mr. John Hogan called with a letter dated February 13, 1864 (copy inclosed, marked C), bearing the official signature of James A. Hardie . . . directed to Major-General Rosecrans . . . with an indorsement in the handwriting and bearing the signature of the President . . . intended, as he (Hogan) claimed, to abrogate entirely in this State the circular order printed by Bishop Ames. As no official copy of the letter to me of the 13th . . . has been received . . . and as there is a doubt in my mind as to the policy the War Department intends to adopt as regards church property in this State . . . I would respectfully request that more definite instructions be furnished. . . .'' (OR, I, XXXIV, II, 452-53).</p>
<p>A footnote in the source states that neither the order of November 30, 1863, nor the letter from Hardie of February 13, 1864, could be found at the time the <span class="rend-i">Official Records</span> were compiled. As given by McPherson (see note to Lincoln's letter to Stanton, February 11, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>), both the order of November 30 and the modifying order of February 13, were issued over the signature of Edward D.

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS, IHi. General Banks replied on March 26, 1864:</p>
<p>``Your letter relating to the case of Mrs. J. Q. A. Fellows, who was dispossessed of her House by order of the Treasury Agent in New Orleans, was given to me by Mrs Fellows, before I left New Orleans. The case is as follows:---All the real estate in New Orleans belonging to active Rebels was seized by the military authorities as far as it could be identified. It was all made to pay rent to the government, when not in use by the government itself: and carefully protected, until the courts under the law of confiscation should decide the rights of the claimants for repossession. Pending this decision, by an order from the war department, I turned over all this property in the Department, Plantations and other estates to Honble. B. F. Flanders, Treasury agent, who assumed possession, collected the rents, controlled the occupancy, and when it seemed to him proper, restored these estates . . . to the Rebels who claimed them:---the cases still pending in the District court of the United States. The only control over any of this property that I have relates to that which is required for miliary uses. The rest is under the exclusive control of the Treasury Agent, and I am required to assist with military force, the execution of any order he gives concerning the disposition of this property by the same general order No: 88 of the War Department.</p>
<p>``Mr: Fellows is an honorable and perfectly loyal man, as thoroughly so as Mr: Flanders or any man in New Orleans, but he is weak enough to believe that the constitution of Louisiana can be restored as it was. . . . He was active in the Riddell election which took place when I was in Texas. . . . There can be . . . no other cause for the ejectment of his family, than that this course was politically unacceptable to Mr: Flanders, and his friends. He assigned this house to an officer of the army who was to pay rent as Mr Fellows had done, and made a demand upon me in writing for the support I was required to give him by war Dept: orders No: 88, which with the greatest reluctance I gave him---hence the visit of Mrs Fellows to Washington. She had a good case, but it concerns the Treasury officers, not the war Department. When she presented me your letter directing an investigation of the case, I immediately requested Brigadier General [James] Bowen to present the case in person to Mr Flanders, and requested his attention to your request. He replied that when Colonel Dudley, the occupant surrendered the house, he would assign it to Mrs Fellows, and not till then. Colonel Dudley is now commanding a Brigade of Cavalry in front of the enemy here It is very hard<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;187</span>
for me to order the family of a soldier, who is in the field, out of a house which is assigned to him by the officers of the Treasury who have by orders of the War &amp; Treasury Departments exclusive control over it.</p>
<p>``The Secretary of the Treasury should be required to give such orders to his agent in New Orleans as may be required in this case. . . . I enclose copies of all the papers in this case, and have written to Mrs Fellows, and to Senator Foote, a full statement of the facts involved. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>

<p>``I respectfully introduce . . . Mr. O[liver]. C. Gibbs, Postmaster of Wareham, Mass. who on many occasions during the past three years has been detailed to visit various camps and Hospitals of the army, as a Messenger of charity and relief to Massachusetts soldiers. I have learned through Mr Gibbs and otherwise, that persons of color, both freemen and refugees from slavery, desiring to pass northward from Washington, seeking to better their fortunes and support their families by reaching Massachusetts, are forcibly and against their will detained. I am at a loss to understand by what color of pretended authority people not charged with crime, and not being engaged in the military service, and being in the peace of the law, are thus subjected to hardship and wrong. Aside from the oppressiveness of such treatment against which I respectfully remonstrate, I appeal in behalf of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, whose right to receive immigrants from all parts of the Union choosing to come here is thus unlawfully interfered with. Suppose the passage of Germans and Irishmen seeking to buy land and make their homes in the great land states of the West was denied, and they were compelled to remain in New England or New York, how long would such an embargo on population be endured by Illinois, and her neighboring States. . . . The industry of Massachusetts imperatively demands every laborer now on her soil or willing to come. The people of Massachusetts, in addition to furnishing her quota of soldiers, manufacture one third of all the woollen goods in the country, without which the army cannot live a day. And notwithstanding the shoe contracts in which she directly participates, many of the shoes contracted for by. . . other States are farmed out at a profit to her shoemakers . . . hold at least one twelfth of the National Loan. How long then can we continue to furnish soldiers, help clothe the army, fabricate ships, machinery and munitions of war, subscribe to the National Loans, and furnish internal revenue if persons desiring to make their way hither are forbidden to come? . . .''

<div class="opener">His Excellency. John A. Andrew Executive Mansion,<br>
Governor of Massachusetts Washington, February 18. 1864.</div>
<p>Yours of the 12th. was received yesterday. If I were to judge from the letter, without any external knowledge, I should suppose that all the colored people South of Washington were struggling to get to Massachusetts; that Massachusetts was anxious to receive and retain the whole of them as permanent citizens; and that the United States Government here was interposing and preventing this. But I suppose these are neither really the facts, nor meant to be asserted as true by you. Coming down to what I suppose to be the real facts, you are engaged in trying to raise colored troops for the U.S. and wish to take recruits from Virginia, through Washington, to Massachusetts for that object; and the loyal Governor of Virginia, also trying to raise troops for us, objects to your taking his material away; while we, having to care for all, and being responsible alike to all, have to do as much for him, as we would have to do for you, if he was, by our authority, taking men from Massachusetts to fill up Virginia regiments. No more than this has been intended by me; nor, as I think, by the Secretary of War. There may have been some abuses of this, as a rule, which, if known, should be prevented in future.</p>
<p>If, however, it be really true that Massachusetts wishes to afford a permanent home within her borders, for all, or even a large number of colored persons who will come to her, I shall be only too glad to know it. It would give relief in a very difficult point; and I would not for a moment hinder from going, any person who is free by the terms of the proclamation or any of the acts of Congress.</p>

<div class="opener">February 18, 1864</div>
<p>By the President of the United States of America:</p>
<p>A Proclamation.</p>
<p>Whereas, by my Proclamation of the nineteenth of April, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, the ports of the States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas, were, for reasons therein set forth, placed under blockade; and whereas, the port of Brownsville in the district of Brazos Santiago in the State of Texas, has since been blockaded, but as the blockade of said port may now be safely relaxed with advantage to the interests of commerce:</p>
<p>Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, pursuant to the authority in me vested by the fifth section of the act of Congress approved on the 13th. of July 1861, entitled, ``an act further to provide for the collection of duties on imports, and for other purposes,'' do hereby declare that the blockade of the said port of Brownsville shall so far cease and determine from and after this date, that commercial intercourse with said port, except as to persons, things and information hereinafter specified, may, from this date, be carried on, subject to the laws of the United States, to the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and until the rebellion shall have been suppressed, to such orders as may be promulgated by the General Commanding the Department, or by an officer duly authorized by him and commanding at said port. This Proclamation does not authorize or allow the shipment or conveyance of persons in or intending to enter the service of the insurgents, or of things or information intended for their use, or for their aid or comfort, nor except upon the permission of the Secretary of War or of some officer duly authorized by him, of the following prohibited articles, namely---cannon, mortars, firearms, pistols, bombs, grenades, powder, saltpetre, sulphur, balls, bullets, pikes, swords, boardingcaps,</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;193</span>(always excepting the quantity of the said articles which may be necessary for the defence of the ship and those who compose the crew) saddles, bridles, cartridge-bag material, percussion and other caps, clothing adapted for uniforms, sail cloth of all kinds, hemp and cordage, intoxicating drinks, other than beer and light native wines.</p>
<p>To vessels clearing from foreign ports, and destined to the port of Brownsville, opened by this Proclamation, licenses will be granted by Consuls of the United States upon satisfactory evidence that the vessels so licensed will convey no persons, property or information excepted or prohibited above, either to or from the said port; which licenses shall be exhibited to the Collector of said port immediately on arrival, and if required, to any officer in charge of the blockade; and on leaving said port, every vessel will be required to have a clearance from the Collector of the Customs, according to law, showing no violation of the conditions of the license. Any violations of said conditions will involve the forfeiture and condemnation of the vessel and cargo, and the exclusion of all parties concerned from any further privilege of entering the United States during the war for any purpose whatever.</p>
<p>In all respects, except as herein specified, the existing blockade remains in full force and effect as hitherto established and maintained, nor is it relaxed by this Proclamation except in regard to the port to which relaxation is or has been expressely applied.</p>
<p>In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>
<p>[L.S.]</p>
<p>Done at the city of Washington, this eighteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, and of the Independence of the United States the eighty-eighth. ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

My dear Sir Washington, Feb. 23. 1864.</div>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS, RPB (ADfS?), DLC-RTL. The printed circular opposing the renomination of President Lincoln and advocating nomination of Secretary Chase was issued over the signature of Samuel C. Pomeroy. On February 22 Chase wrote Lincoln:</p>
<p>``It is probable that you have already seen a letter printed in the <span class="rend-i">Constitutional Union</span> Saturday afternoon, &amp; reprinted in the <span class="rend-i">Intelligencer</span> this morning, written by Senator Pomeroy, as Chairman of a Committee of my political friends.</p>
<p>``I had no knowledge of the existence of this letter before I saw it in the <span class="rend-i">Union</span>.</p>
<p>``A few weeks ago several gentlemen called on me &amp; expressed their desire, which, they said, was shared by many earnest friends of our common cause, that I would allow my name to be submitted to the consideration of the people in connexion with the approaching election of Chief Magistrate. I replied that I feared that any such use of my name might impair my usefulness as Head of the Treasury Department &amp; that I much preferred to continue my labors where I am &amp; free from distracting influences, until I could honorably retire<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;201</span>
from them. We had several interviews. After consultation, and conference with others, they expressed their united judgment that the use of my name as proposed would not affect my usefulness in my present position, and that I ought to consent to it. I accepted their judgment as decisive; but at the same time told them distinctly that I could render them no help, except what might come incidentally from the faithful discharge of public duties, for these must have my whole time. I said also that I desired them to regard themselves as not only entirely at liberty, but as requested, to withdraw my name from consideration wherever, in their judgment the public interest would be promoted by so doing.</p>
<p>``The organization of the Committee, I presume, followed these conversations; but I was not consulted about it; nor have I been consulted as to its action; nor do I even know who compose it. I have never wished that my name should have a moment's thought in comparison with the common cause of enfranchisement &amp; restoration or be continued before public a moment after the indication of a preference by the friends of that cause for another.</p>
<p>``I have thought this explanation due to you as well as to myself. If there is anything in my action or position which, in your judgment, will prejudice the public interest under my charge I beg you to say so. I do not wish to administer the Treasury Department one day without your entire confidence.</p>
<p>``For yourself I cherish sincere respect and esteem; and, permit me to add, affection. Differences of opinion as to administrative action have not changed these sentiments; nor have they been changed by assault upon me by persons who profess themselves to spread representations of your views and policy. You are not responsible for acts not your own; nor will you hold me responsible except for what I do or say myself.</p>
<p>``Great numbers now desire your reelection. Should their wishes be fulfilled by the suffrages of the people I hope to carry with me, into private life the sentiments I now cherish, whole and unimpaired.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>Chase's statement that he had no knowledge of the circular before it appeared in print is contradicted by a statement of James M. Winchell, author-in-fact of the circular, who wrote, in reply to Jacob W. Schuckers' <span class="rend-i">Life and Public Services of Salmon Portland Chase</span> (1874), a detailed account of the Pomeroy Committee which included the following: ``<span class="rend-i">Mr. Chase was informed of this proposed action and approved it fully</span>. He told me himself that the arraignment of the Administration. . . was one which he thoroughly indorsed and would sustain. The circular was, therefore, sent out.'' (J. M. Winchell to editor, September 14, 1874, New York <span class="rend-i">Times</span>, September 15, 1874. Italics are in the source.)</p>

<p>``For me, I feel certain, that Illinois is loyal, and will demonstrate it, not only in the convention, but at the polls---in November.

Letters from William Jayne, congressional delegate from the territory (February 3), Representative Asahel W. Hubbard of Iowa (February 27), and James M.

Although orders removing Waldron and appointing Pinney under date of March 2 were sent to Lincoln by James B. Fry on March 4, Lincoln merely filed the letter with the endorsement ``William Jayne---about Dakotah affairs.'' On April 21, Fry wrote Nicolay, ``I enclose herewith, a letter from Capt. George M.

<p>Your telegram of the 26th instant asking for a copy of my dispatch to Warren Jordan, esq., at Nashville Press office, has just been referred to me by Governor Johnson. In my reply to Mr. Jordan, which was brief and hurried, I intended to say that in the county and State elections of Tennessee the oath prescribed in the proclamation of Governor Johnson on the 26th of January, 1864, ordering an election in Tennessee on the first Saturday in March next, is entirely satisfactory to me as a test of loyalty of all persons proposing or offering to vote in said elections, and coming from him would better be observed and followed. There is no conflict between the oath of amnesty in my proclamation of 8th December, 1863, and that prescribed by Governor Johnson in his proclamation of the 26th ultimo. No person who has taken the oath of amnesty of 8th December, 1863, and obtained a pardon thereby, and who intends to observe the same in good faith, should have any objection to taking that prescribed by Governor Johnson as a test of loyalty. I have seen and examined Governor Johnson's proclamation, and am entirely satisfied with his plan, which is to restore the State government and place it under the control of citizens truly loyal to the Government of the United States.</p>

[The aspect of this case, as presented by this order and report, is entirely new to me, I having personally known nothing of the order, commission, or report, until now presented for my consideration.] In the correspondence between the Governor of New-York and myself last summer, I understood him to complain that the enrolments in several of the Districts of that State had been neither accurately nor honestly made; and, in view of this I for the draft then immediately ensuing, ordered an arbitrary reduction of the quotas in several of the Districts, wherein they seemed too large, [for the draft then immediately ensuing,] and said ``After this drawing these four Districts and also the seventeenth and twentyninth shall be carefully re-enrolled, and, if you please, agents of yours may witness every step of the process'' In a subsequent letter I believe some additional Districts were put into the list of those to be re-enrolled. My idea was to do the work over, according to the law, in presence of the complaining party, and thereby to correct anything which might be found amiss. The</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;211</span>Commission, whose work I am considering, seem to have proceeded upon a totally different idea. Not going forth to find men at all, they have proceeded altogether upon paper examinations and mental processes. One of their conclusions, as I understand is, that as the law stands, and attempting to follow it, the e[n]rolling officers could not have made the enrolments much more accurately than they did. The report, on this point, might be useful to Congress.</p>
<p>The Commission conclude that the quotas for the draft should be based upon entire population, and they proceed upon this basis to give a table for the State of New-York, in which some districts are reduced, and some increased. For the now ensuing draft, let the quotas stand as made by the enrolling officers, in the Districts wherein this table requires them to be increased; and let them be reduced according to the table, in the others. This to be no precedent for subsequent action; but as I think this report may, on full consideration, be shown to have much that is valuable in it, I suggest that such consideration be given it; and that it be especially considered whether it's suggestions can be conformed to without an alternation of the law.

If, however, the scale of wages and the regulations adopted by Superintendent Eaton [John Eaton, superintendent of Freed-men], approved by Major-General Grant and myself, be adopted, and the control be continued by the military authorities, there is yet time to lease plantations by the Treasury agent and provide for a vast amount of labor.

My dear Sir: Washington, February 29. 1864.</div>
<p>I would have taken time to answer yours of the 22nd. sooner, only that I did not suppose any evil could result from the delay, especially as, by a note, I promptly acknowled[ged] the receipt of<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;213</span>
yours, and promised a fuller answer. Now, on consideration, I find there is really very little to say. My knowledge of Mr. Pomeroy's letter having been made <span class="rend-i">public</span> came to me only the day you wrote; but I had, in spite of myself, known of it's <span class="rend-i">existence</span> several days before. I have not yet read it, and I think I shall not. I was not shocked, or surprised by the appearance of the letter, because I had had knowledge of Mr. Pomeroy's Committee, and of secret issues which I supposed came from it, and of secret agents who I supposed were sent out by it, for several weeks. I have known just as little of these things as my own friends have allowed me to know. They bring the documents to me, but I do not read them---they tell me what they think fit to tell me, but I do not inquire for more. I fully concur with you that neither of us can be justly held responsible for what our respective friends may do without our instigation or countenance; and I assure you, as you have assured me, that no assault has been made upon you by my instigation, or with my countenance.</p>
<p>Whether you shall remain at the head of the Treasury Department is a question which I will not allow myself to consider from any stand-point other than my judgment of the public service; and, in that view, I do not perceive occasion for a change. Yours truly A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>``A short time since Mr A.

With this understanding Mr Lewis proceeded up the river to confer with Mr Mellen. To-day I received a second visit from Mr Lewis, and also a communication from Mr. Mellen. From the letter I understand that Mr Lewis has promised to insure planters owning their own estates protection, but that he proposes to tax each of them five per cent on the crops raised by them in consideration of such protection being given, and for his services in consideration therewith.</p>
<p>``My plan is to encourage all to cultivate their estates, and to afford protection as far as it can properly be given, they working under the system adopted; and I cannot admit the policy of their paying for any protection given, to any individual, and therefore I cannot sanction Mr Lewis' plan Indeed I desire no assistance outside of the Treasury Agents, and the Military authorities now charged with the work. It seems to me that Mr Lewis' plan is a selfish one, having his own interest at stake, and I can hardly suppose he fully explained his views to you'' (DLC-RTL).</p>

<p>``The President directs me to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 30th March, and to state in reply that Mr Lewis has no authorization from him for any such purpose as you mention.

<p>``To the People of Arkansas:</p>
<p>``It affords the Genl commanding the highest gratification to be able to say that, by the conduct of the army under his command, in connection with the Administration of the Government by its officers at Washington, peace has, so far been restored in your midst as to enable you to institute proceedings for the restoration of the civil government, by which order may be firmly established and the rights of persons and property secured against violence and the dangers of anarchy.</p>
<p>``The convention of your citizens held at Little Rock during the last month, has adopted a constitution and submitted it to you for your approval or rejection. That constitution is based upon the principles of freedom and it is for you now to say by your voluntary and unbiased action whether it shall be your fundamental law, while it may have deficits in the main in accordance with the views of that portion of the people who have been resisting the fratricidal war which has been made during the last three years to overthrow the government of our country.</p>
<p>``The convention has fixed the 14th day of March next on which to decide this great question and the General commanding is only following the instructions of his government when he says to you that every facility will be affixed for the expression of your sentiments uninfluenced by any considerations save those which effect your own interests and those of your posterity. If you will now institute a government of your own, he feels great confidence in assuring you that quiet and security will soon be restored to your Eastern borders. Those who have been unwisely led by the counsel of bad men to engage in the unjustifiable and wicked rebellion will speedily return and acknowledge<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;222</span>
the rightful sovereignty of the state as well as the supremacy of the national Govt. over the whole dominion and peace will prevail. . . . The election will be held and the returns made in accordance with the Schedule adopted by the convention interference from any quarter will be allowed to prevent free expression of the loyal men of the state on that day. The schedule will be hereto appended. To render the election valid there must be cast five thousand four hundred &amp; six (5406) votes.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>

<p>I have written before, and now repeat, the United States Government must not undertake to run the churches.

It will not do for the United States to appoint trustees, supervisors, or other agents for the churches.

Sometime <span class="rend-i">circa</span> March 4-10, 1864, a letter was drafted, possibly by Bates, although the undated copy in the Lincoln Papers is not in Bates' autograph:</p>
<p>``Applications have been frequently made to me to order the completion of the South West Branch of the Pacific Railroad. The measure has been recommended by four or five of the Major Generals commanding at different times in that section. I made an order for its completion to Lebanon in June 1862, which order still remains unexecuted.</p>
<p>``Mr. Gibson [Charles Gibson, solicitor of U.S. Court of Claims] on behalf of the Railroad Company now proposes that if the General Government will furnish the iron, the company will grade, &amp; otherwise complete the road &amp; furnish it with rolling stock.</p>
<p>``While I desire to see Missouri prosper I can only view this subject from a strictly national stand point.</p>
<p>``You will examine into the matter &amp; if you should be of the opinion that the interests of the United States would be promoted by furnishing this iron, you may enter into an agreement with the company to do so, &amp; may in that event order the Quartermaster at St. Louis to purchase it, being very particular in such agreement to guard well the interests of the National Government.</p>
<p>``From the lights before me I am inclined to the opinion it would be well to secure the early completion of the road as far as Springfield'' (DLC-RTL, 2901-2, misdated ``[1863]'').</p>

<p>``The Govr. and Gibson are not content with the Presidents letter to Genl. Rosecrans, about completing the S.W. Branch of our Pacific R.R. and want me to try to get him to make it stronger. It only directs the Genl. to enquire into the subject and report. We want it to authorise the Genl. if he finds that the road would be advantageous to the military service, to act definitively, and furnish the iron, as fast as the company can lay it down.</p>
<p>``I hope to convince the President that the latter is the better course---better for the service, better for the State and better for himself. . . .</p>

<div class="opener">Hon. John A. J. Creswell Executive Mansion,<br>
My dear Sir: Washington, March 7, 1864.</div>
<p>I am very anxious for emancipation to be effected in Maryland in some substantial form. I think it probable that my expressions of a preference for <span class="rend-i">gradual</span> over <span class="rend-i">immediate</span> emancipation, are misunderstood. I had thought the <span class="rend-i">gradual</span> would produce less confusion, and destitution, and therefore would be more satisfactory; but if those who are better acquainted with the subject, and are more deeply interested in it, prefer the <span class="rend-i">immediate</span>, most certainly I have no objection to their judgment prevailing. My wish is that all who are for emancipation in <span class="rend-i">any form</span>, shall co-operate, all treating all respectfully, and all adopting and acting upon the major opinion, when fairly ascertained. What I have dreaded is the danger that by jealousies, rivalries, and consequent ill-blood---driving one another out of meetings and conventions---perchance from the polls---the friends of emancipation themselves may divide, and lose the measure altogether. I wish this letter to not be<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;227</span>
made public; but no man representing me as I herein represent myself, will be in any danger of contradiction by me. Yours truly</p>
<p>A. LINCOLN.</p>

Third---Over two hundred thousand (200 000) dollars of the assets of the Saving Bank of Portsmouth have been traced into his hands &amp; he refuses to give any account of it &amp; lies when he is examined about it.

<p>The nation's appreciation of what you have done, and it's reliance upon you for what remains to do, in the existing great struggle, are now presented with this commission, constituting you Lieutenant General in the Army of the United States. With this high honor devolves upon you also, a corresponding responsibility. As the country herein trusts you, so, under God, it will sustain you. I scarcely need to add that with what I here speak for the nation goes my own hearty personal concurrence.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; AD, owned by Ulysses S. Grant, III, Washington, D.C. On the night of March 8, 1864, General Grant reported to President Lincoln at the White House in obedience to orders received at Nashville, Tennessee, several days before. The president's weekly reception was in progress, but following an ovation to General Grant, Lincoln arranged to meet him later for a private conference. Nicolay's report of the conference is as follows:</p>
<p>``The President here made an appointment with him for the formal presentation next day of his commission as lieutenant-general. `I shall make a very short speech to you,' said Lincoln, `to which I desire you to reply, for an object; and that you may be properly prepared to do so I have written what I shall say, only four sentences in all, which I will read from my manuscript as an example which you may follow and also read your reply---as you are perhaps not so much accustomed to public speaking as I am; and I therefore give you what I shall say so that you may consider it. There are two points that I would like to have you make in your answer: First, to say something which shall prevent or obviate any jealousy of you from any of the other generals in the service; and second, something which shall put you on as good terms as possible with the Army of the Potomac. If you see any objection to doing this, be under no restraint whatever in expressing that objection to the Secretary of War.' '' (Nicolay and Hay, <span class="rend-i">Abraham Lincoln: A History</span>, VIII, 340-41).</p>
<p>The next day at one o'clock the presentation took place ``in presence of the Cabinet, General Halleck, two members of Grant's staff, and the President's private secretary. . . .'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>.). Following Lincoln's speech, Grant read his pencilled reply as follows:</p>
<p>``Mr. President:</p>
<p>``I accept this commission with gratitude for the high honor confered.</p>
<p>``With the aid of the noble armies that have fought on so many fields for our common country, it will be my earnest endeavor not to disappoint your expectations.</p>
<p>``I feel the full weight of the responsibilities now devolving on me and know that if they are met it will be due to those armies, and above all to the<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;235</span>
favor of that Providence which leads both Nations and men.'' (AD, DLC-Grant Papers).</p>

<p>``I venture to address you touching a matter of great importance which has been committed to your discretionary judgment, by a special order of the President. . . . I shall not trouble you. . . with any detailed. . . facts, nor any prolonged argument. . . because my friend, Mr Gibson who will hand you this, is fully possessed of the subject, and has. . . all needful documents. . . I desire however to say that, long ago (perhaps two years---&amp; ever since) I urged upon the government here, the immediate completion of that road, as a military necessity, and as a measure of great and obvious economy, in money, time, and actual force necessary, not only to the defence of that frontier, but also to the reestablishment of the national authority, still farther south and west. In my judgment, the same necessity and the same motives of economy still exist. . . .</p>
<p>``The measure, if now adopted and promptly acted upon, will, I think, yield immediate fruits---1. It will stranguilize Missouri into order &amp; peace: 2. It will deter the enemy from any attempt, even by guerrillas, to continue the war in S.W. Mo. and N.W. Arkansas: 3. It will set free a large force, now required to guard that region, either to serve in other fields, where the enemy is still in force, or to return to agriculture. . . .</p>
<p>``I know that the President heretofore was favorable to the measure, and I am fully convinced that he believes, with me, now, that if it had been then<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;238</span>

<p>``Under the provisions of the Act of April 4th 1862, which authorizes the President to assign to command officers <span class="rend-i">of the same grade</span>, without regard to <span class="rend-i">seniority</span>, of <span class="rend-i">rank</span>, the undersigned, a Major General, was assigned, in July 1862, to the command of the land forces of the United States. Since that time the higher grade of Lieutenant General has been created, and the distinguished officer promoted to that rank has received his armies now and reported for duty. I, therefore, respectfully request that orders be issued placing him in command of the Army and retiring me from that duty. In making this request I am influenced solely by a desire to conform to the provisions of the law, which, in my opinion impose upon the Lieutenant General the duties and responsibilities of General in Chief of the Army.''

The consolidation throws out one set of officers, and which ever set it may be, it offends either the Governor or a U.S. Senator. We can not afford to offend either, while we can avoid it.

Allow me to suggest that if you wish to remain in the military service, it is very dangerous for you to get temporarily out of it; because, with a Major General once out, it is next to impossible for even the President to get him in again.

<p>``Yesterday I arrived here on a short leave of absence. It was my intention to attend the meeting of the National Committee on the 22nd but I could not leave my command in time on account of Gen. Howard's absence.</p>
<p>``I should be glad to have a conversation with you about political matters and should already have called upon you but for the necessity of having first the permission of the War Dept. to go to Washington. An arrangement might perhaps be made which might render it possible for me to take an active part in the presidential canvass. Things seem to be in a somewhat confused state, and . . . I . . . fear the consequences of the contest now being carried on inside of the Union-party. . . .</p>
<p>``If it should be agreeable to you to see me at Washington, please let me know as soon as convenient---not to forget the required permission from the War Dept., as I should not like to be arrested.</p>
<p>``I am very glad you gave Sigel the Dept. of West-Virginia. It was a very judicious measure in every respect.</p>
<p>``Have you heard already of the difficulties between Gen. Hooker and myself, of the court of inquiry. I demanded and obtained and of the opinion of that court in my favor and against Hooker? If you have been informed of what happened there, you will already have come to the conclusion that it is impossible for me to continue in my command . . . and ardently hope that the rumor about Gen. Hooker's being transferred . . . in consequence of Gen. Grant's and Thomas' representations to the War Dept., prove true. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>On March 8, Schurz wrote again: ``Several days ago . . . I wrote you a few lines for the purpose of bringing about an interview with you at which we might exchange our views on pending political questions. I requested you to let me know whether this would be agreeable. . . . I desire to have that interview . . . not only because I am as warm a friend of our common cause as ever, but your friend also. Waiting for a few words in reply in vain, I have come to the conclusion that either you did not receive my letter or do not desire me to visit Washington.

I therefore invite the early attention of Congress to the subject. ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

Hendershot of the Eighth Michigan Volunteers, born in December, 1850, was barely twelve years old when he distinguished himself at the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13, 1862. He was discharged for disability at Falmouth, Virginia, December 27, 1862, and accounts of his exploits in the Battle of Murfreesboro, are unreliable. Following his discharge, he became something of a celebrity and an attraction at Barnum's Museum. His drum, referred to by Lincoln, was the present of the Tribune Association of New York. There is no record of his appointment by Stanton, but he was eventually employed as messenger in the office of U.S. Treasurer Francis E.

For it has been said, all that a man hath will he give for his life; and while all contribute of their substance the soldier puts his life at stake, and often yields it up in his country's cause. The highest merit, then, is due to the soldier. [Cheers.]</p>
<p>In this extraordinary war extraordinary developments have manifested themselves, such as have not been seen in former wars; and amongst these manifestations nothing has been more remarkable than these fairs for the relief of suffering soldiers and their families. And the chief agents in these fairs are the women of America. [Cheers.]</p>
<p>I am not accustomed to the use of language of eulogy; I have never studied the art of paying compliments to women; but I must say that if all that has been said by orators and poets since the creation of the world in praise of woman were applied to the women of America, it would not do them justice for their conduct during this war. I will close by saying God bless the women of America! [Great applause.]</p>

<div class="textindentlevelx">
<div class="opener">Hon. Secretary of War: Executive Mansion,<br>
My dear Sir: Washington, March 18. 1864.</div>
<p>I am so pressed in regard to prisoners of war in our custody, whose homes are within our lines, and who wish to not be exchanged, but to take the oath and be discharged, that I hope you will pardon me for again calling up the subject. My impression is that we will not ever force the exchange of any of this class; that taking the oath, and being discharged, none of them will again go to the rebellion, but the rebellion again coming to them, a considerable per centage of them, probably not a majority, would rejoin it; that by a cautious discrimination the number so discharged would not be large enough to do any considerable mischief in any event; would relieve distress in, at least some meritorious cases; and would give me some relief from an intolerable pressure.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;255</span>I shall be glad therefore to have your cheerful assert to the discharge of those whose names I may send, which I will only do with circumspection. Yours truly A. LINCOLN</p>
<p>In using the strong hand, as now compelled to do, the government has a difficult duty to perform. At the very best, it will by turns do both too little and too much. It can properly have to motive of revenge, no purpose to punish merely for punishment's sake. While we must, by all available means, prevent the overthrow of the government, we should avoid planting and cultivating too many thorns in the bosom of society. These general remarks apply to several classes of cases, on each of which I wish to say a word.</p>
<p>First, the dismissal of officers when neither incompetency, nor intentional wrong, nor real injury to the service, is imputed. In such cases it is both cruel and impolitic, to crush the man, and make him and his friends permanent enemies to the administration if not to the government itself. I think of two instances. One wherein a Surgeon, for the benefit of patients in his charge, needed some lumber, and could only get it by making a false certificate wherein the lumber was denominated ``butter &amp; eggs'' and he was dismissed for the false certificate. The other a Surgeon by the name of Owen<span class="ptr"><a name="7_255_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_255_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> who served from the beginning of the war till recently, with two servants, and without objection. when upon discovery that the servants were his own <span class="rend-i">sons</span>, he was dismissed.</p>
<p>Another class consists of those who are known or strongly suspected, to be in sympathy with the rebellion. An instance of this is the family of Southern,<span class="ptr"><a name="7_255_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_255_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> who killed a recruiting officer last autumn, in Maryland. He fled, and his family are driven from their home, without a shelter or crumb, except when got by burthening our friends more than our enemies. Southern had no justification to kill the officer; and yet he would not have been killed if he had proceeded in the temper and manner agreed upon by your-self and Gov. Bradford. But this is past. What is to be done with the family? Why can they not occupy their old home, and excite much less opposition to the government than the manifestation of their distress is now doing? If the house is really needed for the public service; or if it has been regularly confiscated and the title transferred, the case if different.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;256</span>Again, the cases of persons, mostly women, wishing to pass our lines, one way or the other. We have, in some cases, been apparantly, if not really, inconsistent upon this subject---that is, we have forced some to go who wished to stay, and forced others to stay who wished to go. Suppose we allow all females, with ungrown children of either sex, to go South, if they desire, upon absolute prohibition against returning during the war; and all to come North upon the same condition of not returning during the war, and the additional condition of taking the oath.</p>
<p>I wish to mention two special cases---both of which you well remember. The first is that of Yocum.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_256_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_256_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[4]</a></span> He was unquestionably guilty. No one asking for his pardon pretends the contrary. What he did, however, was perfectly lawful, only a short while before, and the change making it unlawful had not, even then been fully accepted in the public mind. It is doubtful whether Yocum did not suppose it was really lawful to return a slave to a loyal owner, though it is certain he did the thing secretly, in the belief that his superiors would not allow it if known to them. But the great point<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;257</span>
with me is that the severe punishment of five years at hard labor in the Penitentiary is not at all necessary to prevent the repetition of the crime by himself or by others. If the offence was one of frequent recurrence, the case would be different; but this case of Yocum is the single instance which has come to my knowledge. I think that for all public purposes, and for all proper purposes, he has suffered enough.</p>
<p>The case of Smithson is troublesome.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_257_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_257_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[5]</a></span> His wife and children are quartered mostly on our friends, and exciting a great deal of sympathy, which will soon tell against us. What think you of sending him and his family South, holding the sentence over him to be re-inforced if he returns during the war.</p>

<p>``I am directed by the President to request you to issue a warrant for the pardon of William Yocum, with the following recital.</p>
<p>``Whereas one William Yocum was convicted by a General Court Martial sitting in Washington D.C. in January 1864, of aiding in kidnapping and abstracting an employee of the United States from the military service. . . and was sentenced to confinement at hard labor, for five years, in the Penitentiary at Albany N.Y.</p>
<p>`` `And whereas, previous to his said conviction, the said William Yokum had been a loyal and patriotic citizen, and a faithful and efficient servant of the Government;</p>
<p>`` `And whereas the said William Yokum is an aged man, and has a large family dependent on his labor for support; and has now suffered a sufficient punishment for the offence committed;</p>
<p>`` `And whereas Hon. G. Clay Smith, Hon. Lucian Anderson, Hon. Brutus J. Clay, Hon. W. H. Randall, Hon. S. L. Casey and many other highly respectable citizens have earnestly petitioned for his pardon;</p>
<p>`` `Now therefore &amp;c: &amp;c: &amp;c:. . . .''.(DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>Seward forwarded a copy to Stanton with a note to the effect that the requisition would not be complied with ``until I shall learn your views on the subject.'' Stanton endorsed: ``My views are that the President could commit no greater mistake, and in no way do the military service, his own administration, the sense of public justice &amp; his own reputation so much harm as by granting this pardon and in the name of the Department, and on behalf of the colored people to whom the President has promised protection and emancipation I respectfully protest against the pardon of a man who while in the Military service gave a colored man under his command into the hands of a slave dealer to be sold &amp; held in bondage. His crime in my judgment is greater than that of the African Slave trader and his pardon will in my opinion injure the government in the eyes of all civilized nations and destroy the faith of the colored man in the government.''

<div class="opener">Gentlemen of the Committee. March 21, 1864</div>
<p>The honorary membership in your Association, as generously tendered, is gratefully accepted.</p>
<p>You comprehend, as your address shows, that the existing rebellion, means more, and tends to more, than the perpetuation of African Slavery---that it is, in fact, a war upon the rights of all working people. Partly to show that this view has not escaped my attention, and partly that I cannot better express myself, I read a passage from the Message to Congress in December 1861:</p>
<p>``It continues to develop that the insurrection * * * * * * * * * * till all of liberty shall be lost.''<span class="ptr"><a name="7_259_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_259_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>The views then expressed remain unchanged, nor have I much to add. None are so deeply interested to resist the present rebellion as the working people. Let them beware of prejudice, working division and hostility among themselves. The most notable feature of a disturbance in your city last summer, was the hanging of some working people by other working people. It should never be so. The strongest bond of human sympathy, outside of the family relation, should be one uniting all working people, of all nations, and tongues, and kindreds. Nor should this lead to a war upon property, or the owners of property. Property is the fruit of labor ---property is desirable --- --- is a positive good in the world. That some should be rich, shows that others may become rich, and hence is just encouragement to industry and enterprize. Let not him who is houseless pull down the house of another; but let him<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;260</span>
labor diligently and build one for himself, thus by example assuring that his own shall be safe from violence when built.</p>

Major General Schurz. March 23. 1864</div>
<p>My dear Sir: The letter, of which the above is a copy, was sent to you, before Mr. Willmann saw me; and now yours of the 19th. tells me you did not receive it.</p>
<p>I do not wish to be more specific about the difficulty of your coming to Washington. I think you can easily conjecture it. I perceive no objection to your making a political speech when you are where one is to be made; but quite surely speaking in the North, and fighting in the South, at the same time, are not possible. Nor could I be justified to detail any officer to the political campaign during it's continuance, and then return him to the Army</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADf, DLC-RTL. See Lincoln to Schurz, March 13, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>, a signed copy of which precedes this letter in the manuscript draft. On March 19 Schurz wrote Lincoln from New York:</p>
<p>``Mr. [Andreas] Willmann of this city, who delivered my last letter . . . was informed . . . that you had written to me in reply, but as I have received no letter whatever from you, there must be some mistake. . . . From what Mr. Willmann told me of his conversation with you I am led to believe that you consider my taking part in the electoral contest this summer as attended with some difficulty in asmuch as it would not be an easy thing to find a proper command and position for me afterwards. This as well as your silence upon my letters I can explain upon no other supposition than that you have entirely hindered my intentions.</p>
<p>``Under present circumstances I do not want to appear to feel bound by any<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;263</span>
favor from anybody. If I can take an active part in the political contest consistently, with my position in the army, I shall be glad . . . expecting nothing for myself but to resume my old position . . . after the election. If a political activity be deemed inconsistent with my military position, I shall then have to make my choice. . . . I wish to assure you here emphatically, that in neither case I would make any demands on the administration. . . .</p>
<p>``About this and several other matters of a political nature. I desired to have a conversation with you. At a time like this I would not consider it out of place to volunteering advice and opinion about a few points of some importance. . . . It is somewhat difficult for me to understand why I do not receive this permission in reply to my letter.</p>
<p>``. . . . For your information I send you a copy of my argument before the Court of Inquiry which I had printed for my own private use. . . . I would be completely satisfied with the command of a respectable division in some other Dept., Gen. Sigel's for instance,. . . and that, in case the 11th Corps is taken from under Gen. Hooker, I shall be quite content with the command I now have. . . .</p>
<p>``I am quite sick, suffering from all sorts of complaints common in camps. I expect however to be able in a few days to return to the Army. Until then I should be glad to know what I shall have to do, and on my way there to visit Washington, unless my presence there be particularly undesirable.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>On March 21 Schurz wrote again:</p>
<p>``At last I have received your letter of the 13th; it was not directed to my hotel and I did, therefore, not hear of it until it was advertised in the papers.</p>
<p>``My letters to you were dictated by the ardent desire to see the unity of the party unimpaired at the next presidential election, for without that unity the prospective result seems to me extremely doubtful. . . . I thought that my opinion and advice upon several points of importance might be entitled to some consideration. . . for there are things which it is better to discuss in private than in public. In believing that a full exchange of views might be desirable not only to me but also to you, it seems I was mistaken. While a number of generals were permitted to visit Washington, it is difficult for me to understand, how my presence there could be attended with unpleasant difficulties or even be detrimental to the public service. I might perhaps claim a right to know, what particular unpleasant difficulty or what detriment to the service is meant, but I apprehend I have to submit not only to an incomprehensible refusal but also to a mysterious hint as to the cause of that refusal. I approached you with the feelings of a friend, not to ask for something but to offer something and I find myself turned off very much like an enemy or a suspicious character. I must confess, I cannot understand this. . . . I did not think it would be as difficult with your assistance to procure me an opportunity to take an active part in the political contest some time in July or August and September; and if you think it is, I shall then have to decide the question of my remaining in the army for myself when the time comes.</p>
<p>``While I regret most sincerely that you deemed best to cut off a full exchange of views, I beg you not to construe this letter as a renewed application for permission to visit Washington. . . .'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>.).</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; AES and AD, DLC-RTL. Lincoln's endorsement is separated from the memorandum as cataloged in the Lincoln Papers, but they seem obviously to belong together. A note from Governor William A. Newell, dated March 23 (but incorrectly cataloged as ``March 25'') is as follows: ``If your Excellency shall determine to sign the paper which I left with you on yesterday I will be greatly obliged if it can be sent to me at Allentown N. Jersey; I do hope that the favor sought will not be refused. The land is valueless, and on the expression of a wish to that effect the whole works will be removed, or relinquished, without compensation, to the Government. It will contribute vastly to the welfare of that portion of the County in which I live, New Jersey has always responded to the calls of your Excellency &amp; I beg to express the hope that this small request of some of her citizens will be allowed. . . .'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>.).</p>
<p>The document which Governor Newell submitted, written on Executive Mansion stationery, reads as follows:</p>
<p>``Permission is hereby given to the Long Branch and Sea-Shore Rail Road Company to use so much of the government property at Sandy Hook, beginning at the Horse Shoe and extending southward, as may be necessary for the construction of suitable dock, depot and track accommodations, with the understanding that the improvements thus designated shall be removed or transfered to the Government whenever it shall be required''</p>
<p>Secretary Stanton referred the matter to General Halleck and Halleck referred to Judge Advocate General Holt, who reported on March 26: ``This, like other property belonging to the government, having been acquired by public law, can only be disposed of under the same sanctions. I am aware of no principle or precedent which can be held to authorise the executive, to transfer either the absolute title to or a usufructuary, interest in property, of the U. States, thus acquired, without the express concurrence of Congress. The rule is believed to be the same, without reference to the amount of interest sought to be conveyed. In this particular case, the privilege of using the land described for the purpose mentioned, would probably prove one of great pecuniary value, to the Rail Road company, but whether of great or little value, in its transfer or bestowal, the government must act through a public law, and not through the will of any one of its Departments.''

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADfS, DLC-RTL. This letter is printed by Hertz (II, 946), without date or addressee. The bill (S.43) did not pass. Commissioner French replied on March 27, 1864:</p>
<p>``Your note of the 25th is recd. and I am greatly surprised at the contents. . . because I have been guilty of no intended impropriety, and of no wrong. I have been cruelly treated by your Secretary of the Interior, and have been <span class="rend-i">forced by him</span>, to defend myself, and, because I have done so, you have been appealed to to crush me. I do not believe you will do so when you know all the facts. . . .</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;267</span>``The Secretary of the Interior, when that excellent man, Caleb B. Smith was Secretary, was charged by Congress, with the supervision and control of the erection of the Capitol Extension and New Dome. He saw fit, of his own accord, to confer upon me the honor and trust of Disbursing Agent. I have bonds in the penalty of $40,000, and entered upon the duty, and performed it, I believe, satisfactorily to Mr. Smith. He resigned, Mr. Usher was appointed. . . removed my Clerk, who was charged with keeping my accounts, and for whose acts, I, alone, was responsible under my bonds, and placed another man in his stead. . . . On the 30th of June, 1863,. . . removing me from the place of disbursing agent,. . . appointed the clerk he had sent. . . with enlarged powers, and a salary of $2500 per annum. At this I felt grieved. . . and addressed to the Secretary, a letter. . . also. . . to you. . . .</p>
<p>``Naturally, I wrote to Senator Foot, informing him of the fact. . . . He replied. . . that as soon as Congress met it was his intention to introduce a bill placing the work on the Extension &amp; Dome under the Commissioner of Public Buildings, where it belonged, &amp; removing the office of Commissioner from any control of the Secy. I drew up a bill which I supposed would carry out what Senator Foot said, and sent it to him, keeping a copy of it. Some time afterwards a friend, to whom I showed the copy, wanted a few copies of it for his own use, and, without the least idea of there being any impropriety in my doing so, having a printing press and type in my office, I printed for him a few copies.</p>
<p>``I had no agency whatever in the introduction of the bill by Senator Foot, as he never mentioned it to me, that I remember, after he came to Washington, before its introduction. I never spoke to a Senator or Representative concerning it, unless spoken to. I had not the least agency in its introduction into the House. . . . After it was. . . referred to the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, I was notified by the Chairman. . . to appear before it on a certain day, which I did, and there met the Secretary of the Interior. He was heard fully, and said something to which <span class="rend-i">I was forced</span> to reply, and, at a subsequent meeting, I did reply. This is all my personal action in the matter. . . . I have never spoken to a member of the Senate Committee, except Senator Foot, on the subject of it. He submitted to me, unasked, some papers sent him by the Secy. for my answer, and I gave it. . . . I have done, Mr. President, exactly what you would have done in my case, and nothing more, except, perhaps, in the printing of about a dozen copies of the bill. . . .</p>
<p>``As I did not seek the passage of the bill in question, I cannot. . . seek to stop it; but I beg of you not to sacrifice me without granting me a personal interview.</p>
<p>``I have submitted your letter to Senator Foot who expressed much surprise at its contents. . . evidently written. . . under a false impression as to the facts, and that he would call upon you tomorrow and assure you that, so far as he was concerned, I had no agency whatever in the introduction of the bill, except that I drew it up for him, a thing that is done daily by officials about the Capital, at the request of members.''

<p>``Mr. Weed was here at the Astor House on my arrival last Saturday morning and I gave him the note you sent him.</p>

You had told him in January last that you thought you would make a change in the Collectorship here, but that thus far it had not been done. He had told you he himself had no personal preference as to the particular man who is to be his successor. He did not think Mr. Barney a bad man but thought him a weak one. His four deputies are constantly intriguing against you. Andrews is doing the same. Changes are constantly being made among the subordinates in the Custom House, and men turned out, for no other real reason than that they take active part in primary meetings &amp;c., in behalf of your re-nomination.</p>
<p>``His only solicitude, he said, was for yourself. He thought that if you were not strong enough to hold the Union men together through the next Presidential election, when it must necessarily undergo a great strain, the country was in the utmost danger of going to ruin.</p>
<p>``His desire was to strengthen you as much as possible and that you should strengthen yourself. You were being weakened by the impression in the popular mind that you hold on with such tenacity to men once in office, although they prove to be incapable and unworthy. This feeling among your friends also raises the question, as to whether, if re-elected, you would change your Cabinet. The present Cabinet is notoriously weak and inharmonious---no Cabinet at all---gives the President no support. Welles is a cypher, Bates a fogy, and Blair at best a dangerous friend.</p>
<p>``Something was needed to reassure the public mind and to strengthen yourself. Chase and Fremont, while they might not succeed in making themselves successful rivals might yet form and lead dangerous factions. Chase was not formidable as a candidate in the field, but by the shrewd dodge of a withdrawal is likely to turn up again with more strength than ever.</p>
<p>``He had received a letter from Judge Davis, in which the Judge wrote him that he had read his (Weed's) letter to you, but that you did not seem ready to act in the appointment of a new Collector, and that he (the Judge) thought it was because of your apprehension that you would be merely getting `out of one muss into another.'</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;269</span>``A change in the Custom House was imperatively needed because one whole bureau in it had been engaged in treasonably aiding the rebellion.</p>
<p>``The ambition of his life had been, not to get office for himself, but to assist in putting good men in the right places. If he was good for anything, it was as an outsider to give valuable suggestions to an administration that would give him its confidence. He feared he did not have your entire confidence---that you only regarded him with a certain degree of leniency; that you only regarded him as being not quite so great a rascal as his enemies charged him with being.</p>
<p>``The above are substantially the points of quite a long conversation. This morning I had another interview with Mr. Weed.</p>
<p>``He had just received Gov. Morgan's letter informing him of the nomination of Hogeboom to fill McElrath's place, and seemed quite disheartened and disappointed. He said he did not know what to say. He had assured your friends here that when in your own good time you became ready to make changes, the new appointments would be from among your friends; but that this promotion of one of your most active and malignant enemies left him quite powerless. He had not yet told any one, but knew it would be received with general indignation, &amp;c &amp;c.</p>

<p>By the President of the United States of America:</p>
<p>A Proclamation.</p>
<p>Whereas, it has become necessary to define the cases in which insurgent enemies are entitled to the benefits of the proclamation of the President of the United States, which was made on the eighth day of December, 1863, and the manner in which they shall proceed to avail themselves of those benefits:</p>
<p>And whereas, the objects of that proclamation were to suppress the insurrection and to restore the authority of the United States, and whereas the amnesty therein proposed by the President was offered with reference to these objects alone:</p>
<p>Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do hereby proclaim and declare that the said proclamation does not apply to the cases of persons who, at the time when they seek to obtain the benefits thereof by taking the oath thereby prescribed are in military, naval or civil confinement or custody, or under bonds or on parole of the civil, military or naval authorities or agents of the United States as prisoners of war or persons detained for offences of any kind, either before or after conviction, and that, on the contrary, it does apply only to those persons who being yet at large and free from any arrest, confinement or duress, shall voluntarily come forward and take the said oath with the<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;270</span>
purpose of restoring peace and establishing the national authority. Prisoners excluded from the amnesty offered in the said proclamation may apply to the President for clemency like all other offenders, and their applications will receive due consideration.</p>
<p>I do farther declare and proclaim that the oath prescribed in the aforesaid proclamation of the 8th. of December, 1863, may be taken and subscribed before any commissioned officer, civil, military or naval, in the service of the United States, or any civil or military officer of a State or Territory not in insurrection, who, by the laws thereof, may be qualified for administering oaths. All officers who receive such oaths are hereby authorized to give certificates thereon to the persons respectively by whom they are made. And such officers are hereby required to transmit the original records of such oaths at as early a day as may be convenient to the Department of State, where they will be deposited and remain in the archives of the Government. The Secretary of State will keep a register thereof, and will on application, in proper cases, issue certificates of such records in the customary form of official certificates.</p>
<p>In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>
<p>[L.S.]</p>
<p>Done at the city of Washington, the twenty-sixth day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, and of the Independence of the United States the eighty-eighth. ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

<p>The Governor of Kentucky is here, and desires to have the following points definitely fixed:</p>
<p>1. That the quotas of troops furnished, and to be furnished by Kentucky, may be adjusted upon the basis as actually reduced by able bodied men of hers having gone into the rebel service; and that she be required to furnish no more than her just quotas upon fair adjustment on such basis.</p>
<p>2. That to whatever extent the enlistment, and drafting, one or both, of colored troops may be found necessary within the State, it may be conducted within the law of Congress; and, as far as practicable, free from colateral embarrasments, disorders, and provocations.</p>
<p>I think these requests of the Governor are reasonable; and I shall be obliged, if you will give him a full hearing, and do the best you can to effect these objects. Yours very truly</p>

Colonel Thomas Worthington of the Forty-sixth Ohio Infantry is listed as having resigned on November 21, 1862, but from his letter to Lincoln, April 12, 1864, it seems obvious that he was dismissed: ``On full consideration I have declined urging on Gen Schenck, the responsibility of my possible return to the service. . . .

<div class="opener">A. G. Hodges, Esq Executive Mansion,<br>
Frankfort, Ky. Washington, April 4, 1864.</div>
<p>My dear Sir: You ask me to put in writing the substance of what I verbally said the other day, in your presence, to Governor Bramlette and Senator Dixon. It was about as follows:</p>
<p>``I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. I can not remember when I did not so think, and feel. And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling. It was in the oath I took that I would, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. I could not take the office without taking the oath. Nor was it my view that I might take an oath to get power, and break the oath in using the power. I understood, too, that in ordinary civil administration this oath even forbade me to practically indulge my primary abstract judgment on the moral question of slavery. I had publicly declared this many times, and in many ways. And I aver that, to this day, I have done no official act in mere deference to my abstract judgment and feeling on slavery. I did understand however, that my oath to preserve the constitution to the best of my ability, imposed upon me the duty of preserving, by every indispensable means, that government---that nation---of which that constitution was the organic law. Was it possible to lose the nation, and yet preserve the constitution? By general law life <span class="rend-i">and</span> limb must be protected; yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life; but a life is never wisely given to save a limb. I felt that measures, otherwise unconstitutional, might become lawful, by becoming indispensable to the preservation of the constitution, through the preservation of the nation. Right or wrong, I assumed this ground, and now avow it. I could not feel that, to the best of my ability, I had even tried to preserve the constitution, if, to save slavery, or any minor matter, I should permit the wreck of government, country, and Constitution all together. When, early in the war, Gen. Fremont attempted military emancipation, I forbade it,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;282</span>
because I did not then think it an indispensable necessity. When a little later, Gen. Cameron, then Secretary of War, suggested the arming of the blacks, I objected, because I did not yet think it an indispensable necessity. When, still later, Gen. Hunter attempted military emancipation, I again forbade it, because I did not yet think the indispensable necessity had come. When, in March, and May, and July 1862 I made earnest, and successive appeals to the border states to favor compensated emancipation, I believed the indispensable necessity for military emancipation, and arming the blacks would come, unless averted by that measure. They declined the proposition; and I was, in my best judgment, driven to the alternative of either surrendering the Union, and with it, the Constitution, or of laying strong hand upon the colored element. I chose the latter. In choosing it, I hoped for greater gain than loss; but of this, I was not entirely confident. More than a year of trial now shows no loss by it in our foreign relations, none in our home popular sentiment, none in our white military force,---no loss by it any how or any<span class="ptr"><a name="7_282_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_282_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> where. On the contrary, it shows a gain of quite a hundred and thirty thousand soldiers, seamen, and laborers. These are palpable facts, about which, as facts, there can be no cavilling. We have the men; and we could not have had them without the measure.</p>
<p>[``]And now let any Union man who complains of the measure, test himself by writing down in one line that he is for subduing the rebellion by force of arms; and in the next, that he is for taking these hundred and thirty thousand men from the Union side, and placing them where they would be but for the measure he condemns. If he can not face his case so stated, it is only because he can not face the truth.['']</p>
<p>I add a word which was not in the verbal conversation. In telling this tale I attempt no compliment to my own sagacity. I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it. Whither it is tending seems plain. If God now wills the removal of a great wrong, and wills also that we of the North as well as you of the South, shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong, impartial history will find therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and goodness of God. Yours truly</p>

<div class="opener">Major General Rosecrans Executive Mansion,<br>
My dear Sir: Washington, April 4th, 1864.</div>
<p>This is rather more social than official, containing suggestions rather than orders. I somewhat dread the effect of your Special</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;284</span>Order, No. 61 dated March 7. 1864. I have found that men who have not even been suspected of disloyalty, are very averse to taking an oath of any sort as a condition, to exercising an ordinary right of citizenship. The point will probably be made, that while men may without an oath, to assemble in a noisy political meeting, they must take the oath, to assemble in a religious meeting.</p>
<p>It is said, I know not whether truly, that in some parts of Missouri, assassinations are systematically committed upon returned rebels, who wish to ground arms, and behave themselves. This should not be. Of course I have not heard that you give countenance to, or wink at such assassinations.</p>
<p>Again, it is complained, that the enlistment of negroes, is not conducted in as orderly a manner, and with as little collateral provocation, as it might be.</p>
<p>So far you have got along in the Department of the Missouri, rather better than I dared to hope; and I congratulate you and myself upon it. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN.</p>

<div class="opener">Executive Mansion,<br>
Major General Banks Washington, April 5. 1864.</div>
<p>I have received a letter from Gen. Charles P. Stone, indorsed by yourself, asking that ``some act, some word, some order may issue from the Executive which shall place my name clear of reproach &amp;c.'' Nothing more definite than this is indicated as to what Gen. Stone desires me to do, or supposes I can do in the case. I can only state the facts of the case from memory, and, of course not with great minuteness or accuracy. Gen. Stone was arrested, as I now think, early in February 1862. Owing to sickness in my family, the Secretary of War made the arrest without notifying me that he had it in contemplation. Gen. McClellan was then General-in-chief, with Head Quarters at Washington, and Gen. Stone was commanding a Division twentyfive or thirty miles above on the Potomac. Learning of the arrest I inquired for the cause, and found it, or the evidence constituting it to consist of three classes. First, the evidence taken in writing by the Committee of Congress on the conduct of the War. The point supposed to be made by this against General Stone was that when before the committee at one time, and excusing himself for not having sent a force from one<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;286</span>
point to another during the battle in which Col. Baker was killed, he stated that the enemy had a redoubt or dirt fort on the route which could not be passed. Afterwards the committee, conceiving that Gen. Stone could have prevented the erection of that fort, and ought to have done so, called him before them again to inquire why he did not, and he then denied that there ever had been a fort at that place. I did not think the evidence, as read to me, made the point conclusively against the general; but that evidence, whatever it is, I suppose is still accessible.</p>
<p>Secondly, evidence taken and put in the form of a report by a detective of Gen. McClellan.</p>

<p>``As a soldier, I make to you my last appeal for justice. . . . It is now more than two years since I was suddenly taken from the command of one of the largest and finest divisions of the Army, and incarcerated in a prison set aside for traitors. . . .</p>
<p>``I remained in prison one hundred and eighty nine days, as true a soldier of the United States as remained in her armies. . . .</p>
<p>``I will not recal the frequent appeals which I made. . . . Appeals for appearance of accuser---appeals for statement of accusation---appeals for hearing---appeals for opportunity of service.</p>
<p>``It is sufficient that none were ever regarded. . . . I was discharged without ever having seen accusation or the name of an accuser. . . .</p>
<p>``After six months of imprisonment and nine months of forced inactivity. . . . I was suddenly ordered . . . to report for duty in the Department of the Gulf. . . .</p>
<p>``A new campaign is now about to open. It may be the last of many which I have had the fortune to participate in. It will perhaps be fortunate for all concerned that it should be so. . . .</p>

McLean, adjutant general of the Department of the Ohio (August 23, 1862 to December 26, 1863), had been ordered to Fort Vancouver as assistant to the provost marshal general and superintendent of recruiting service in Oregon and Washington Territory. Stanton's report of April 7, transmitted by Lincoln, reads as follows:</p>
<p>``In answer to the resolution of the House . . . dated April 4. . . . I have the honor to state---</p>
<p>``1. That Major McLean was ordered to Vancouver because it was deemed expedient for the service that he should go there.</p>

<p>Your Majesty does but justice to my sentiments in the conviction which you have been pleased to express that I will take, in an event so satisfactory to you, and Your Imperial House the same interest which Your Majesty is ever inclined to take in all that concerns the prosperity of the United States, and I beg Your Majesty to accept my sincere congratulations upon the occasion: And so I recommend Your Majesty's Imperial Family to the protection of the Almighty. Your Good Friend ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

<div class="opener">April 18, 1864</div>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen---Calling to mind that we are in Baltimore, we can not fail to note that the world moves. Looking upon these many people, assembled here, to serve, as they best may, the soldiers of the Union, it occurs at once that three years ago, the same soldiers could not so much as pass through Baltimore. The change from then till now, is both great, and gratifying. Blessings on the brave men who have wrought the change, and the fair women who strive to reward them for it.</p>
<p>But Baltimore suggests more than could happen within Baltimore. The change within Baltimore is part only of a far wider change. When the war began, three years ago, neither party, nor any man, expected it would last till now. Each looked for the end, in some way, long ere to-day. Neither did any anticipate that domestic slavery would be much affected by the war. But here we are; the war has not ended, and slavery has been much affected---how much needs not now to be recounted. So true is it that man proposes, and God disposes.</p>
<p>But we can see the past, though we may not claim to have directed it; and seeing it, in this case, we feel more hopeful and confident for the future.</p>
<p>The world has never had a good definition of the word liberty, and the American people, just now, are much in want of one. We all declare for liberty; but in using the same <span class="rend-i">word</span> we do not all mean the same <span class="rend-i">thing</span>. With some the word liberty may mean for each man to do as he pleases with himself, and the product of his labor; while with others the same word may mean for some men to do as they please with other men, and the product of other men's<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;302</span>
labor. Here are two, not only different, but incompatable things, called by the same name---liberty. And it follows that each of the things is, by the respective parties, called by two different and incompatable names---liberty and tyranny.</p>
<p>The shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep's throat, for which the sheep thanks the shepherd as a <span class="rend-i">liberator</span>, while the wolf denounces him for the same act as the destroyer of liberty, especially as the sheep was a black one. Plainly the sheep and the wolf are not agreed upon a definition of the word liberty; and precisely the same difference prevails to-day among us human creatures, even in the North, and all professing to love liberty. Hence we behold the processes by which thousands are daily passing from under the yoke of bondage, hailed by some as the advance of liberty, and bewailed by others as the destruction of all liberty. Recently, as it seems, the people of Maryland have been doing something to define liberty; and thanks to them that, in what they have done, the wolf's dictionary, has been repudiated.</p>
<p>It is not very becoming for one in my position to make speeches at great length; but there is another subject upon which I feel that I ought to say a word. A painful rumor, true I fear, has reached us of the massacre, by the rebel forces, at Fort Pillow, in the West end of Tennessee, on the Mississippi river, of some three hundred colored soldiers and white officers, who had just been overpowered by their assailants.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_302_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_302_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> There seems to be some anxiety in the public mind whether the government is doing it's duty to the colored soldier, and to the service, at this point. At the beginning of the war, and for some time, the use of colored troops was not contemplated; and how the change of purpose was wrought, I will not now take time to explain. Upon a clear conviction of duty I resolved to turn that element of strength to account; and I am responsible for it to the American people, to the christian world, to history, and on my final account to God. Having determined to use the negro as a soldier, there is no way but to give him all the protection given to any other soldier. The difficulty is not in stating the principle, but in practically applying it. It is a mistake to suppose the government is indiffe[re]nt to this matter, or is not doing the best it can in regard to it. We do not to-day <span class="rend-i">know</span> that a colored soldier, or white officer commanding colored soldiers, has been massacred by the rebels when made a prisoner. We fear it, believe it, I may say, but we do not <span class="rend-i">know</span> it. To take the life of one of their prisoners, on the assumption that they murder ours, when it is short of certainty that they do murder ours, might be too serious, too cruel a mistake. We are having the Fort-Pillow affair thoroughly<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;303</span>
investigated; and such investigation will probably show conclusively how the truth is. If, after all that has been said, it shall turn out that there has been no massacre at Fort-Pillow, it will be almost safe to say there has been none, and will be none elsewhere. If there has been the massacre of three hundred there, or even the tenth part of three hundred, it will be conclusively proved; and being so proved, the retribution shall as surely come. It will be matter of grave consideration in what exact course to apply the retribution; but in the supposed case, it must come.</p>

<p>Mr. Webster once stated the proposition that a President could not be so applauded, and ministered unto, when his term of office, and with it, his power to confer favors, drew near to it's close, as he had been in the hey-day of his inaugeration. To illustrate this, he said: ``Politicians---office-seekers---are not sun-flowers; they do not turn upon their god when he sets, the same look they gave when he rose.'' This may be a general truth; but, to my personal knowledge it is not particularly true in Baltimore. For intance, on the 22nd. or 23rd. of February 1861 (so near the end of one and the beginning of the other, as to be doubtful which) I passed through Baltimore, rich with honorable and fat offices, soon to be dispensed, and not one hand reached forth to greet me, not one voice broke the stillness to cheer me. Now, three years having past, and offices having passed away, Baltimore marks my coming, and cheers me when I come. Traitorous malice has sought to wrong Baltimore herein, ascribing to one cause what is justly due to another. For instance the Richmond,<span class="ptr"><a name="7_303_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_303_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> alluding to that passage through Baltimore, said: ``We have no fear of any bold action by the federal government; we remember Baltimore, and our faith is unwavering in Lincoln's cowardice'' Now this is hugely unjust to Baltimore. I take it to be unquestionable that what happened here three years ago, and what happens here now, was contempt of office then, and is purely appreciation of merit now.</p>

<div class="opener">To the House of Representatives April 28, 1864</div>
<p>In obedience to the Resolution of your Honorable body, a copy of which is herewith returned, I have the honor to make the following brief statement which is believed to contain the information sought.</p>
<p>Prior to, and at the meeting of the present Congress, Robert C. Schenck, of Ohio, and Frank P.Blair, Jr. of Missouri, members elect thereto, by and with the consent of the Senate, held commissions from the Executive, as Major Generals in the Volunteer Army. Gen. Schenck tendered the resignation of his said commission and took his seat in the House of Representatives, at the assembling thereof, upon the distinct verbal understanding with the Secretary of war and the Executive, that he might, at any time during the session, at his own pleasure, withdraw said resignation, and return to the field. Gen. Blair was, by temporary assignment of Gen. Sherman, in command of a corps, through the battles in front of Chattanooga, and in the march to the relief of Knoxville, which occurred in the latter days of November, and early days of December last; and, of course was not present at the assembling of Congress. When he subsequently arrived here, he sought, and was allowed, by the Secretary of War and the Executive, the same conditions, and promise, as allowed and made to Gen. Schenck. Gen. Schenck has not applied to withdraw his resignation; but when Gen. Grant was made Lieut. General, producing some change of commanders, Gen. Blair sought to be assigned to the command of a corps. This was made known to Generals Grant and Sherman and assented to by them, and the particular corps for him designated. This was all arranged and understood, as now remembered, so much as a month ago; but the formal withdrawal of Gen. Blair's resignation, and making the order assigning him to the command of the corps, were not consummated at the War Department until last week---perhaps on the 23rd. of April, Inst. As a summary of<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;320</span>
the whole it may be stated that Gen. Blair holds no military commission or appointment, other than as herein stated; and that it is believed he is now acting as a Major General upon the assumed validity of the commission herein stated, in connection with the facts herein stated, and not otherwise. There are some letters, notes, telegrams, orders, entries, and perhaps other documents, in connection with this subject, which it is believed would throw no additional light upon it; but which will be cheerfully furnished, if desired.

<p>I have the honor to transmit herewith an Address to the President of the United States, and through him, to both Houses of Congress, on the condition and wants of the people of East Tennessee, and asking their attention to the necessity of some action on the part of the Government for their relief---and which address is presented by a committee of an organization called ``The East Tennessee Relief Association.''<span class="ptr"><a name="7_321_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_321_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>Deeply commiserating the condition of these most loyal and suffering people, I am unprepared to make any specific recommendation for their relief. The Military is doing, and will continue to do the best for them within its power. Their address represents that the construction of direct Railroad communication between Knoxville and Cincinnati, by way of central Kentucky would be of great consequence in the present emergency. It may be remembered that in the annual Message of December, 1861, such Railroad construction was recommended. I now add that with the hearty concurrence of Congress, I would yet be pleased to construct the road, both for the relief of these people, and for its continuing military importance.

Farnsworth, who had resigned his commission on March 4, 1863, to take up his duties as congressman, was pressing Hurlbut's demand for a court of inquiry. On April 16, 1864, General Sherman telegraphed Hurlbut: ``There has been marked timidity in the management of affairs since Forrest passed north of Memphis. General Grant orders me to relieve you.

In this case the soldier, whom he ordered discharged, while laboring under the charge of desertion, deserted a second time; but the substitute having been provided, it was not deemed proper to suspend the President's order &amp; ask a reconsideration.

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADfS, DLC-RTL. The envelope containing the letter is endorsed by Lincoln ``Letter to each Member of Cabinet, May 3, 1864.'' Individual letters sent to the cabinet members are extant as follows: to Blair (DLC-Blair Papers), to Seward (DNA FS RG 59, Miscellaneous Letters), to Welles (owned by George A. Ball, Muncie, Indiana). The lengthy and divergent replies from the cabinet members are in the Lincoln Papers, but limitations of space forbid adequate quotation and summary. A satisfactory summary may be found in Nicolay and Hay, <span class="rend-i">Abraham Lincoln: A History</span>, VI, 478 ff. All members agreed that the Confederate government should be called on to avow or disavow the massacre. Seward, Chase, Stanton, and Welles agreed in advising that Confederate prisoners equal in numbers to the Union troops massacred should be set apart as hostages, to be executed if the Confederate government avowed the massacre. Usher, Bates, and Blair advised no retaliation against innocent hostages, but advised that orders be issued to commanders to execute the actual offenders (Forrest and any of his command) if captured. Recommendations of the cabinet were not carried out, but see further Lincoln's instructions to Stanton, May 17, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>. For the report of the special committee (Senator Benjamin F. Wade and Representative Daniel W. Gooch) appointed to investigate the massacre, see <span class="rend-i">House Committee Reports No. 65</span>, Thirty-eighth Congress, First Session.</p>
<p>Although attempts have been made to absolve General Forrest and although Forrest's own explanation undertook to place the blame on the Union commander, Major Lionel F. Booth, for declining to surrender the fort before it was stormed, the truth contained in Forrest's own reports to Assistant Adjutant General Thomas J. Jack and to General Leonidas Polk on April 15, 1864, is self-evident. Testimony of survivors was that after they had thrown down their arms the Confederates shot most of those who did not jump into the river. Forrest's report to Jack is as follows:</p>
<p>``. . . Arrived there [Fort Pillow] on the morning of the 12th and attacked the place with . . . about 1,500 men, and after a sharp contest captured the garrison and all of its stores. A demand was made for the surrender, which was refused. The victory was complete, and the loss of the enemy will never be known from the fact that large numbers ran into the river and were shot and drowned. The force was composed of about 500 negroes and 200 white soldiers (Tennessee Tories). The river was dyed with the blood of the slaughtered for 200 yards. There was in the fort a large number of citizens who had fled there to escape the conscript law. Most of these ran into the river and were drowned.</p>
<p>``The approximate loss was upward of 500 killed, but few of the officers escaping.</p>
<p>``It is hoped that these facts will demonstrate to the Northern people that negro soldiers cannot cope with Southerners. We still hold the fort.</p>
<p>``My loss was about 20 killed and about 60 wounded. . . .'' (OR, I, XXXII, I, 610-11).</p>

It is idle for us to be pushing forward subsistence stores if they are lavished and expended on any persons except they belong to the army proper.''</p>
<p>On May 5, 1864, Sherman replied to Lincoln's telegram: ``We have worked hard with the best talent of the country &amp; it is demonstrated that the railroad cannot supply the army &amp; the people too. one or the other must quit &amp; the army don't intend to unless Joe Johnston makes us. The issues to citizens have been enormous &amp; the same weight of corn or oats would have saved thousands of the mules whose carcasses now corduroy the roads and which we need so much.

<p>FELLOW-CITIZENS: I am very much obliged to you for the compliment of this call, though I apprehend it is owing more to the good news received to-day from the army than to a desire to see me. I am, indeed, very grateful to the brave men who have been struggling with the enemy in the field, to their noble commanders who have directed them, and especially to our Maker. Our commanders are following up their victories resolutely and successfully. I think, without knowing the particulars of the plans of Gen. Grant, that what has been accomplished is of more importance than at first appears. I believe I know, (and am especially grateful to know) that Gen. Grant has not been jostled in his purposes; that he has made all his points, and to-day he is on his line as he purposed before he moved his armies. I will volunteer to say that I am very glad at what has happened; but there is a great deal still to be done. While we are grateful to all the brave men and officers for the events of the past few days, we should, above all, be very grateful to Almighty God, who gives us victory.</p>
<p>There is enough yet before us requiring all loyal men and patriots to perform their share of the labor and follow the example of the modest General at the head of our armies, and sink all personal considerations for the sake of the country. I commend you to keep yourselves in the same tranquil mood that is characteristic of that brave and loyal man. I have said more than I expected when I came before you; repeating my thanks for this call, I bid you good-bye. [Cheers.]</p>

<p>``Your telegram touching `the trouble with Dr. Hawks,' and requesting me to ask Bishop Whittingham to give you his view . . . reached me so late . . . that I could do nothing . . . until this morning.</p>
<p>``Knowing that Bp. W. knew nothing of the affair, I carried yr. request to him<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;336</span>
in person. After a full expose, he wrote you a letter in reply, which I have the honor to forward. . . .</p>

<p>``I waited patiently till I became satisfied and assured of his dangerous character, abilities, and operations, then directed my Provt.

<p>Protestant Episcopal Bishop William R. Whittingham's letter, enclosed by Wallace, reads in part as follows: ``There are very strong reasons, personal and official, why I should desire to remain totally unconnected with the case. Nevertheless, I could not, in duty, decline to hear Gen.

<p>The within letter is, to my mind, so obviously intended as a page for a political record, as to be difficult to answer in a straight-forward business-like way. The merits of the Kansas people need not to be argued to me. They are just as good as any other loyal and patriotic people; and, as such, to the best of my ability, I have always treated them, and intend to treat them. It is not my recollection that I said to you Senator Lane would probably oppose raising troops in Kansas, because it would confer patronage upon you. What I did say was that he would probably oppose it because he and you were in a mood of each opposing whatever the other should propose. I did argue generally too, that, in my opinion, there is not a more foolish or demoralizing way of conducting a political rivalry, than these fierce and bitter struggles for patronage.</p>
<p>As to your demand that I will accept or reject your proposition to furnish troops, made to me yesterday, I have to say I took the proposition under advisement, in good faith, as I believe you know; that you can withdraw it if you wish, but that while it remains before me, I shall neither accept or reject it, until, with reference to the public interest, I shall feel that I am ready.

<p>``Kansas has furnished more men according to her population, to crush this rebellion, than any other State in this Union. Her sons, to day; are scattered over the country, defending the Old Flag, while many of her peaceable citizens at home, are being murdered by lawless Guerrillas. Such is the intelligence I received today.</p>
<p>``The Major General Commanding that Department, informed me, he needed more troops to secure protection to the State. I have tendered you two thousand troops, for One hundred days, such as you have accepted from other States, to be used as you might direct through the Commander of that Department, without other cost to the Government than the pay of Volunteers without bounty.</p>
<p>``You refered the matter to the Secretary of War, for his consideration. I found that officer overburdened with business of such magnatude to the country, that he could not be seen, either upon my request or yours.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;341</span>``I have to ask that you will either accept or reject the proposition, I made in my communication of the 12th. instant.</p>

<p>``You will do me the favor to reply at your earliest convenience'' (IHi).</p>
<p>On May 16, Carney replied:</p>
<p>``Your note of 14th instant is received. I regret you do not consider the threatening attitude of affairs in Kansas of sufficient public interest to accept at once the offer I made you of two thousand troops. . . .</p>
<p>``I did not intend to advise as to public interest outside of Kansas. . . .</p>
<p>``Kansas has been, and still is, in deep distress, and needs the fostering care of the Government, therefore, I made to you the proposition I did in my communication of the 12th. . . . This care . . . I feel the citizens of my state have a right to claim. . . . Their sufferings and sacrifices have been great . . . because her sons have gone forth to fight the battles of their common country, and left their homes in the care of the Government. Yet their homes have been visited by the assassin, and are again threatened by these murderous outlaws.</p>

<p>That the insurgents having refused to exchange, or to give any account or explanation in regard to colored soldiers of the United States captured by them, a number of insurgent prisoners equal to the number of such colored soldiers supposed to have been captured by said insurgents will, from time to time, be assigned and set aside, with reference to such captured colored soldiers, and will, if the insurgents assent, be exchanged for such colored soldiers; but that if no satisfactory attention shall be given to this notice, by said insurgents, on or before the first day of July next, it will be assumed by the government of the United States, that said captured colored troops shall have been murdered, or subjected to Slavery, and that said government will, upon said assumption, take such action as may then appear expedient and just.</p>

<p>Evening before last two gentlemen called on me, and talked so earnestly about financial matters, as to set me thinking of them a little more particularly since. And yet only one idea has occurred, which I think worth while even to suggest to you. It is this: Suppose you change your five per cent loan to six, allowing the holders of the fives already out to convert them into sixes, upon taking each an equal additional amount at six.

For an account of the hoax perpetrated by Joseph Howard, Jr., the same reporter who had created the hoax story of Lincoln's arrival in Washington in 1861 disguised in ``a Scotch cap and long military cloak,'' see Sandburg, <span class="rend-i">Abraham Lincoln: The War Years</span>, III, 53 ff. The spurious proclamation as printed in the New York <span class="rend-i">World</span> and <span class="rend-i">Journal of Commerce</span>, May 18, 1864, reads:</p>
<p>``Executive Mansion,</p>
<p>``<span class="rend-i">Fellow Citizens of the United States:</span> May 17, 1864.</p>
<p>``In all seasons of exigency, it becomes a nation carefully to scrutinize its line of conduct, humbly to approach the Throne of Grace, and meekly to implore forgiveness, wisdom, and guidance.</p>
<p>``For reasons known only to Him, it has been decreed that this country should be the scene of unparalleled outrage, and this nation the monumental sufferer of the Nineteenth Century. With a heavy heart, but an undiminished confidence in our cause, I approach the performance of a duty rendered imperative by my sense of weakness before [the] almighty, and of justice to the people.</p>
<p>``It is necessary that I should tell you that the first Virginia campaign under Lieut. Gen. Grant, in whom I have every confidence, and in whose courage and fidelity the people do well to honor, is virtually closed. He has conducted his great enterprise with discreet ability. He has crippled their strength and defeated their plans.</p>
<p>``In view, however, of the situation in Virginia, the disaster at Red River, the delay at Charleston, and the general state of the country, I, Abraham Lincoln, do hereby recommend that Thursday, the 26th day of May, A.D., 1864, be solemnly set apart throughout these United States as a day of fasting, humiliation and prayer.</p>
<p>``Deeming furthermore that the present condition of public affairs presents an extraordinary occasion, and in view of the pending expiration of the service of (100,000) one hundred thousand of our troops, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, by virtue of the power vested in me by the Constitution<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;349</span>
and the laws, have thought fit to call forth, and hereby do call forth the citizens of the United States, between the ages of (18) eighteen and (45) fortyfive years, to the aggregate number of (400,000) four hundred thousand, in order to suppress the existing rebellious combinations, and to cause the due execution of the laws.</p>
<p>``And, furthermore, in case any State, or number of States, shall fail to furnish by the fifteenth day of June next, their assigned quota, it is hereby ordered that the same be raised by an immediate and peremptory draft.</p>
<p>``The details for this object will be communicated to the State authorities through the War Department.</p>
<p>``I appeal to all loyal citizens to favor, facilitate and aid this effort to maintain the honor, the integrity and the existence of the National Union, and the perpetuity of popular government.</p>
<p>``In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. Done at the City of Washington this 17th day of May, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, and of the independence of the United States the eighty-eighth.</p>

From foregoing statement of facts your excellency will readily perceive that an ingenious rogue knowing the manner in which the editors were supplied with much of their telegraphic news could by selecting his time &amp; opportunity easily impose upon Editors or compositors the most wicked &amp; fraudulent reports. On wednesday morning at about three oclock a messenger who well counterfeited the regular messenger of the Associated Press presented himself at all save one of the editorial rooms of the Papers connected with the associated Press and delivered to the foreman in the absence of the night editors sealed envelopes containing manifold Paper similar in all respects to that used by the association upon which was written a fraudulent Proclamation purporting to be signed by your Excellency and countersigned by the honorable Secy of State. The very late hour at which the fraud was perpetrated left no time for consideration as to the authenticity or genuineness of this document &amp; the copy in most of the offices was at once cut up into small pieces and given into the hands of the compositors &amp; in two cases the fraud was not discovered or suspected even till after the whole morning edition of the Papers were printed off &amp; distributed The undersigned beg to state to your excellency that the fraud which succeeded with the World and the Journal of Commerce was one which from the circumstances attending it &amp; the practices of the associated Press was extremely natural and very liable to have succeeded in any daily newspaper establishment in this city &amp; inasmuch as in the judgement of the undersigned the editors and proprietors of the World were innocent of any knowledge of wrong in the publication of the fraudulent document and also in view of the fact that the suspension<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;350</span>

<p>In regard to the order of General Burnside suspending the Chicago Times now nearly a year ago, I can only say I was embarrassed with the question between what was due to the Military service on the one hand, and the Liberty of the Press on the other, and I believe it was the despatch of Senator Trumbull and yourself, added to the proceedings of the meeting which it brought me, that turned the scale in favor of my revoking the order.

<p>I am again pressed with the claim of Mr. Marshall O. Roberts, for transportation of what was called the Naval Brigade from NewYork to Fortress Monroe. This force was a special organization got up by one Bartlett, in pretended pursuance of written authority from me, but in fact, pursuing the authority in scarcely any thing whatever. The credit given him by Mr. Roberts, was given in the teeth of the express declaration that the government would not be responsible for the class of expences to which it belonged. After all some part of the transportation became useful to the government, and equitably should be paid for; but I have neither time or means to ascertain this equitable amount, or any appropriation to pay it with if ascertained. If the Quarter-Master at New-York can ascertain what would compensate for so much of the transport[at]ion as did result usefully to the government, it might be a step towards reaching justice. I write this from memory; but I believe it is substantially correct. A. LINCOLN.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; Chicago <span class="rend-i">Tribune</span>, July 15, 1864. This letter is reproduced as printed in a report of Arnold's speech to a Republican mass meeting on July 14. In introducing the letter Arnold spoke as follows: ``General Burnside . . . issued an order for its [Chicago <span class="rend-i">Times</span>] suppression. That order was revoked by the President. The President was petitioned by prominent and good citizens of Chicago to revoke the order. I was requested to join in such a petition. I refused. I was asked to transmit their message to the President. This I did, as I do for all petitions sent through me, asking for his prompt and careful consideration. Exactly what I did will appear from the following copy of a note addressed to me from the President on this subject: [text of letter as reproduced above].''</p>
<p>Although the manuscript of Lincoln's letter, as quoted by Arnold, has not been found, it seems reasonable to accept the text as authentic, especially since a draft of the letter, in Arnold's autograph and written on Executive Mansion stationery, is preserved in the Lincoln Papers along with Arnold's letter to Lincoln dated April 24. The precise relationship of Lincoln's autograph draft of May 25, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>, to Arnold's draft of the present letter is not entirely clear. A reasonable assumption would be that Lincoln showed Arnold the draft of May 25, that Arnold revised it to the more specific statement in Arnold's draft, and that Lincoln thereupon copied and signed the letter on May 27, according to Arnold's wishes. Variations in the <span class="rend-i">Tribune</span> text and Arnold's draft are indicated in succeeding footnotes.</p>

Throughout my heavy, and perplexing responsibilities here, to the day of his death, it would scarcely wrong any other to say, he was my most generous friend.

<p>In response to the preamble and resolutions of the American Baptist Home Mission Society, which you did me the honor to present, I can only thank you for thus adding to the effective and almost unanamous support which the Christian communities are so zealously giving to the country, and to liberty. Indeed it is difficult to conceive how it could be otherwise with any one professing christianity, or even having ordinary perceptions of right and wrong. To read in the Bible, as the word of God himself, that ``In the sweat of <span class="rend-i">thy</span> face shalt thou eat bread,[''] and to preach there-from that, ``In the sweat of <span class="rend-i">other mans</span> faces shalt thou eat bread,'' to my mind can scarcely be reconciled with honest sincerity. When brought to my final reckoning, may I have to answer for robbing no man of his goods; yet more tolerable even this, than for robbing one of himself, and all that was his. When, a year or two ago, those professedly holy men of the South, met in the semblance of prayer and devotion, and, in the name of Him who said ``As ye would all men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them'' appealed to the christian world to aid them in doing to a whole race of men, as they would have no man do unto themselves, to my thinking, they contemned and insulted God and His church, far more than did Satan when he tempted the Saviour with the Kingdoms of the earth. The devils attempt was no more false, and far less hypocritical. But let me forbear, remembering it is also written ``Judge not, lest ye be judged.''</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; DS, DNA RG 46, Senate 38A F2. The resolution of May 28 called upon the president to ``inform the Senate . . . whether he has, and when, authorized a person alleged to have committed a crime against Spain or any of its dependencies to be delivered up to officers of that government, and whether such delivery was had, and if so, under what authority of law or of treaty it was done.''</p>
<p>Seward transmitted documents in the case of Jose A. Arguelles, a Spanish officer in Cuba, who had seized a cargo of over 1,000 negroes landed on the coast from a slaver, and had received over $15,000 in prize money. Obtaining twenty days' leave to visit New York, he was discovered during his absence to have falsely reported the deaths of 141 of the negroes and sold them for himself. No treaty of extradition between Spain and the United States then being in existence, Spanish officials requested that he be returned for trial. He was sent back to Havana and turned over to officials there.</p>
<p>Seward's report of May 30 concludes:</p>
<p>``There being no treaty of extradition between the United States and Spain, nor any act of Congress directing how fugitives from justice in Spanish dominions shall be delivered up, the extradition in the case referred to . . . is understood by this department to have been made in virtue of the law of nations and the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p>``Although there is a conflict of authorities concerning the expediency of exercising comity towards a foreign government by surrendering, at its request, one of its own subjects charged with the commission of crime within its territory . . . yet a nation is never bound to furnish asylum to dangerous criminals who are offenders against the human race. . . .''

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; AE, DLC-Nicolay Papers. Lincoln's endorsement is written on a letter of John G. Nicolay to John Hay, Eutaw House, Baltimore, June 5, 1864:</p>
<p>``Arrived here safely---find quite a number of delegates already in, but have not yet talked much with them.</p>
<p>``One of the first men I met was B. C. Cook, who stands at the head of our Illinois delegation, and had quite a long and confidential talk with him. He told me he had thought of going to Washington tomorrow, but seeing me he concluded he could sufficiently post himself.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;377</span>``He premised by telling me that the milk-and-water Lincoln resolution which was first reported to the Illinois State Convention, was cooked up by a few plotters, to the utter surprise and astonishment of nine-tenths of the convention, and by only a part of the committee, and was with the others reported to the convention when there was but a small attendance, it being late at night, but that the convention very handsomely repudiated them, referred them to a new committee, which introduced and passed others of the right stripe. Cook does not seem to know thoroughly who were at the bottom of the matter. He thinks [Thomas J.] Turner was the chief manager. [Joseph] Medill is understood to have declared himself opposed to the resolution in committee but seems to have contented himself with the mere expression of his dissent, after which he went away without further active opposition. Strangely enough one or two men have told me that Wm A Grimshaw, either of his own volition or under the influence of others, was in the scheme. Jack [Jackson Grimshaw] on the contrary, Cook told me, was open and hearty for Lincoln.</p>
<p>``Cook says there will be three or four disaffected members in the delegation from Illinois, but that nevertheless the delegation will vote and act as a unit, under the instructions of the convention and also the will of the large majority of the delegation. He says the delegation will in good faith do everything they can for Lincoln that is in arranging the Vice P., the Committees, Platform &amp;c. taking his own nomination of course as beyond question.</p>
<p>``What transpired at home, and what he has heard from several sources, have made Cook suspicious that Swett may be untrue to Lincoln. One of the straws which lead him to this belief is that Swett has telegraphed here urging the Illinois delegation to go for Holt for Vice President.</p>
<p>``I told Cook that I thought Lincoln would not wish even to indicate a preference for V.P. as the rival candidates were all friendly to him.</p>
<p>``There will be some little trouble in arranging the matter of the contested seats from Missouri. The Radicals seem to have the technical right to be admitted. They threaten to withdraw from the convention if the conservatives are also admitted; but promise to abide the action of the convention if they (the Radicals) obtain the seats. Cook says they intimated to him that they would even promise to vote for Lincoln in the convention, for the promise of an admission to seats.</p>
<p>``Whitelaw Reid is here and told me this evening that the Radicals conceded Lincoln's re-nomination, but their present game was to make a very radical platform.</p>
<p>``Cook wants to know confidentially whether Swett is all right---whether in urging Holt for V.P. he reflects the Presidents wishes---whether the President has any preference, either personally or on the score of policy---or whether he wishes not even to interfere by a confidential indication. Also whether he thinks it would be good policy to give the Radical delegates from Missouri the seats, on their promising to vote for him.</p>
<p>``Please get this information for me, if possible. Write and send your letter by express so that it will reach me by the earliest practicable hour on tomorrow (Monday). This will go to you by express by the 7 A.M. train tomorrow so that you ought to have it by ten A.M.</p>
<p>``Address me at Eutaw House.''</p>
<p>In accord with Lincoln's instructions, Hay answered on June 6:</p>
<p>``Yours of yesterday just received &amp; read to the President. Swett is unquestionably all right in regard to the President, but his presentation of Col. Holt's name is entirely of his own suggestion. He seemed not to have considered the bad effect of the contiguity of Illinois &amp; Kentucky. . . . He has never even mentioned Col. Holt's name to the Prest. for the place. . . .</p>
<p>``The President wishes not to interfere in the nomination even by a confidential suggestion. He also declines suggesting anything in regard to platform or the organization of the Convention. . . .</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;378</span>``Do not infer from what I have said above that the President objects to Swett presenting Col. Holt's name.

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy, DLC-RTL; New York <span class="rend-i">Tribune</span>, June 10, 1864. The manuscript copy (not in Lincoln's autograph) preserved in the Lincoln Papers provides the text as reproduced. Variants in the <span class="rend-i">Tribune</span> are given in succeeding footnotes. The remarks of William Dennison, president of the convention and chairman of the notification committee, are reproduced from the <span class="rend-i">Tribune</span>:</p>
<p>``MR. PRESIDENT---The National Union Convention, which closed its sittings at Baltimore yesterday, appointed a Committee consisting of one from each State, with myself as Chairman, to inform you of your unanimous nomination by that Convention for election to the office of President of the United States. That Committee, I have the honor of now informing you, is present. On its behalf I have also the honor of presenting you with a copy of the resolutions or platform adopted by that Convention, as expressive of its sense, and of the sense of the loyal people of the country, which it represents, of the principles and policy that should characterize the administration of the Government in the present condition of the country. I need not say to you, sir, that Convention, in thus unanimously nominating you for reelection, but gave utterance to the almost universal voice of the loyal people of the country. To doubt of your triumphant election, would be little short of abandoning the hope of a final suppression of the Rebellion and the restoration of the Government over the insurgent States. Neither the Convention nor those represented by that body entertained any doubt as to the final result, under your administration, sustained by that loyal people, and by our noble Army and gallant Navy. Neither did the Convention, nor do this Committee doubt the speedy suppression of this most wicked and unprovoked Rebellion. (A copy of the resolutions was here handed to the President.) I would add, Mr. President, that it would be the pleasure of the Committee to communicate to you, within a few days, through one of its most accomplished members, Mr. [George William] Curtis of New-York, by letter, more at length the circumstances under which you have been placed in nomination for the Presidency.''</p>
<p>The Platform of the Union National Convention presented by Dennison is as follows:</p>
<p>``1. <span class="rend-i">Resolved</span>, That it is the highest duty of every American citizen to maintain against all their enemies the integrity of the Union and the paramount authority of the Constitution and laws of the United States; and that, laying aside all differences of political opinion, we pledge ourselves, as Union men, animated by a common sentiment and aiming at a common object, to do everything in our power to aid the Government in quelling by force of arms the Rebellion now raging against its authority, and in bringing to the punishment due to their crimes the Rebels and traitors arrayed against it. [Prolonged applause.]</p>
<p>``2. <span class="rend-i">Resolved</span>, That we approve the determination of the Government of the United States not to compromise with Rebels, or to offer them any terms of peace, except such as may be based upon an unconditional surrender of their hostility and a return to their just allegiance to the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that we call upon the Government to maintain this position, and to prosecute the war with the utmost possible vigor to the complete suppression of the Rebellion, in full reliance upon the self-sacrificing patriotism, the heroic valor, and the undying devotion of the American people to their country and its free institutions.</p>
<p>``3. <span class="rend-i">Resolved</span>, That as Slavery was the cause, and now constitutes the strength, of this Rebellion, and as it must be, always and everywhere, hostile to the principles of Republican Government, justice and the National safety demand its utter and complete extirpation from the soil of the Republic [applause]:---and that while we uphold and maintain the acts and proclamations by which the Government, in its own defense, has aimed a death-blow at this gigantic evil, we are in favor, furthermore, of such an amendment to the Constitution, to be made by the people in conformity with its provisions, as shall terminate and<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;382</span>
forever prohibit the existence of slavery within the limits or the jurisdiction of the United States. [Tremendous applause, the delegates rising and waving their hats.]</p>
<p>``4. <span class="rend-i">Resolved</span>, That the thanks of the American people are due to the soldiers and sailors of the Army and Navy [applause], who have periled their lives in defense of their country and in vindication of the honor of its flag; that the nation owes to them some permanent recognition of their patriotism and their valor, and ample and permanent provision for those of their survivors who have received disabling and honorable wounds in the service of the country; and that the memories of those who have fallen in its defense shall be held in grateful and everlasting remembrance. [Loud applause and cheers.]</p>
<p>``5. <span class="rend-i">Resolved</span>, That we approve and applaud the practical wisdom, the unselfish patriotism and the unswerving fidelity to the Constitution and the principles of American liberty, with which ABRAHAM LINCOLN has discharged, under circumstances of unparalleled difficulty, the great duties and responsibilities of the Presidential office; that we approve and endorse, as demanded by the emergency and essential to the preservation of the nation, and as within the provisions of the Constitution, the measures and acts which he has adopted to defend the nation against its open and secret foes; that we approve, especially, the Proclamation of Emancipation, and the employment as Union soldiers of men heretofore held in slavery [applause]; and that we have full confidence in his determination to carry these and all other Constitutional measures essential to the salvation of the country into full and complete effect. [Vociferous applause.]</p>
<p>``6. <span class="rend-i">Resolved</span>, That we deem it essential to the general welfare that harmony should prevail in the National Councils, and we regard as worthy of public confidence and official trust those only who cordially endorse the principles proclaimed in these resolutions, and which should characterize the administration of the government. [Applause.]</p>
<p>``7. <span class="rend-i">Resolved</span>, That the Government owes to all men employed in its armies, without regard to distinction of color, the full protection of the laws of war---[applause]---and that any violation of these laws, or of the usages of civilized nations in time of war, by the Rebels now in arms, should be made the subject of prompt and full redress. [Prolonged applause.]</p>
<p>``8. <span class="rend-i">Resolved</span>, That foreign immigration, which in the past has added so much to the wealth, development of resources and increase of power to this nation, the asylum of the oppressed of all nations, should be fostered and encouraged by a liberal and just policy. [Applause.]</p>
<p>``9. <span class="rend-i">Resolved</span>, That we are in favor of the speedy construction of the Railroad to the Pacific coast. [Applause.]</p>
<p>``10. <span class="rend-i">Resolved</span>, That the National faith, pledged for the redemption of the public debt, must be kept inviolate, and that for this purpose we recommend economy and rigid responsibility in the public expenditures, and a vigorous and just system of taxation: and that it is the duty of every loyal State to sustain the credit and promote the use of the National currency. [Applause.]</p>
<p>``11. <span class="rend-i">Resolved</span>, That we approve the position taken by the Government that the people of the United States can never regard with indifference the attempt of any European Power to overthrow by force or to supplant by fraud the institutions of any Republican Government on the Western Continent---[prolonged applause]---and that they will view with extreme jealousy, as menacing to the peace and independence of their own country, the efforts of any such power to obtain new footholds for Monarchical Governments, sustained by foreign military force, in near proximity to the United States.

<p>SIR---In every light in which the state of the Hawaiian Islands can be contemplated, it is an object of profound interest to the United States. Virtually it was once a colony.</p>
<p>It is now a near and intimate neighbor. It is a haven of shelter and refreshment for our merchant fishermen, seamen, and other citizens, when on their lawful occasions they are navigating the eastern seas and oceans. Its people are free, and its laws, language and religion are largely the fruits of our own teaching and example.</p>
<p>The distinguished part which you, Mr. Minister, have acted in the history of that interesting country is well known here. It gives me pleasure to assure you of my sincere desire to do what I can to render now your sojourn in the United States agreeable to yourself, satisfactory to your sovereign, and beneficial to the Hawaiian people.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; New York <span class="rend-i">Tribune</span>, June 11, 1864. Lincoln replied to a short speech by Elisha H. Allen, envoy and minister from Hawaii, upon presenting his credentials. This item has been misdated in other sources: June 10 (Hertz, II, 933) and June 11 (NH, XI, 132). On June 7, 1864, Secretary Seward wrote Lincoln as follows: ``It has been found convenient to defer the presentation of Mr. Allen from tomorrow (as indicated in my note of yesterday) until the following day, at half past eleven o'clock of which I shall have the honor of presenting that gentleman, if the time be acceptable to you.'' (DLC-RTL). As printed by the <span class="rend-i">Tribune</span>, Lincoln's reply is part of a despatch from Washington dated June 10, which does not specify the date of delivery.</p>

<p>GENTLEMEN: I am very much obliged to you for this compliment. I have just been saying, and will repeat it, that the hardest of all speeches I have to answer is a serenade. I never know what to say on these occasions. I suppose that you have done me this kindness in connection with the action of the Baltimore convention, which has recently taken place, and with which, of course, I am very well satisfied. (Laughter and applause.) What we want, still more than Baltimore conventions or presidential elections, is success under Gen. Grant. (Cries of ``Good,'' and applause.) I propose that you constantly bear in mind that the support you owe to the brave officers and soldiers in the field is of the very first importance, and we should therefore bend all our energies to that point. Now, without detaining you any longer, I propose that you help me to close up what I am now saying with three rousing cheers for Gen. Grant and the officers and soldiers under his command.</p>

McCrea, who had been arrested and banished from the Department commanded by General Rufus Saxton at Beaufort, South Carolina, for procuring whisky for enlisted men. A resident of New York who formerly had operated a plantation in the West Indies, McCrea had acquired an abandoned plantation near Beaufort and was undertaking to raise cotton with hired labor. The letter from McAdam of June 9, 1864, which bears Lincoln's endorsement is a lengthy summary of the case, from McCrea's point of view, in which McAdam attempts to reinforce his ineffectual interview of the day before.</p>

He asked for this permission on account of the outrage committed upon Major Bond of his Staff who was some time ago court martialed for coming to Washington<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;387</span>
under General Rosecrans' orders. Recently Gov. Yates has joined in Rosecrans' request, asking that Sanderson shall be sent for. `If it is a matter of such overwhelming importance,' said the President, `I don't think Sanderson is the proper person to whom to entrust it. I am inclined to think that the object of the General is to force me into a conflict with the Secretary of War and to make me overrule him in this matter. This at present I am not inclined to do. I have concluded to send you out there to talk it over with Rosecrans and to ascertain just what he has. I would like you to start tomorrow.'</p>
<p>``He gave me, in the morning before I was out of bed, this note [<span class="rend-i">supra</span>] to deliver to Rosecrans.''</p>
<p>On June 13 Secretary Stanton telegraphed Rosecrans, ``The President directs that the archives and papers of the Belgian consulate, alleged to have been taken from the possession of Mr. Hunt, late Belgian consul, by your provostmarshal, be returned to him, and that no proceedings be had against him without orders from this department; that you release him if he be imprisoned, and that you report by telegraph what proceedings, if any, have been had by your provost-marshal, or any other officer under your command, in reference to Mr. Hunt, or the papers and archives of his consulate, and the grounds or causes of such proceedings.'' (OR, I, XXXIV, IV, 337).</p>
<p>On June 14, Rosecrans wrote Lincoln:</p>
<p>``Major Hay has received such full details of the character of the conspiracy alluded to in my dispatches as will suffice to show you what important national interests are involved in the proper understanding and handling of the matter, and satisfy you that the whole should be laid immediately before you by an officer capable of giving such details as will enable you to adopt a policy the execution of which will give adequate security to the public interests.</p>
<p>``I beg leave therefore to call your attention to a few points in connexion with the information he will give you.</p>
<p>``1. The organization not only threatens great danger in case our military operations are unsuccessful or indecisive in their results but is now working great general mischief by spreading discontent among the people, circulating false reports injurious to the Government, creating doubt and discouragement, aiding spies suppliers of arms and other contraband and giving aid comfort and encouragement to the rebellion.</p>
<p>``2. These conspirators are ready to do anything in their power such as assisting guerillas and, whenever opportunity offers, joining them in destroying R.R. bridges, capturing our outposts threatening our depots and aiding in the work of plunder and murder and devastation. The present raid in Kentucky was invited and as you will observe unquestionably received aid from this organization bridges having been destroyed and other mischief done at distances of thirty or forty miles from the rebel raiders.</p>
<p>``I knew that this raid was contemplated and my men warned the Natl authorities authorities [<span class="rend-i">sic</span>] of it some weeks ago. Of course too much is involved to permit me to send manuscript communications to you either by mail or express. My duty to you the country and to the persons whose lives would be endangered by want of prompt and proper action all forbid such a course</p>
<p>``3. I take this opportunity to call your attention to the fact that my application for a remittance from the contingent fund to defray the expenses involved in this and other investigations demanded by the interests of the service in this Department have been refused by the Secretary of War. That refusal has been most injurious to the public interests and unwarranted by the condition of affairs here as well as by the customs of the service.</p>
<p>``4 The obstacles interposed to my communication with you, this refusal of necessary means to conduct the secret service so important in this Department convince me that your interposition is needed to prevent the interests of the people and the good name of your administration from being seriously injured.</p>
<p>``5. As the 4th of July is generally understood to be the chosen time for the<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;388</span>
conspirators to begin their work of mischief prompt action will be necessary. No interference should be permitted with the arrests which have or may be made of parties involved such as Hunt and others whose friends will undoubtedly appeal to you.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>

<div class="textindentlevelx">
<div class="opener">June 16, 1864</div>
<p>I suppose that this toast was intended to open the way for me to say something. [Laughter.] War, at the best, is terrible, and this war of ours, in its magnitude and in its duration, is one of the most terrible. It has deranged business, totally in many localities, and partially in all localities. It has destroyed property, and ruined homes; it has produced a national debt and taxation unprecedented, at least in this country. It has carried mourning to almost every home, until it can almost be said that the ``heavens are hung in black.'' Yet it continues, and several relieving coincidents [<span class="rend-i">coincidences</span>] have accompanied it from the very beginning, which have not been known, as I understood [<span class="rend-i">understand</span>], or have any knowledge of, in any former wars in the history of the world. The Sanitary Commission, with all its benevolent labors, the Christian commission, with all its Christian and benevolent labors, and the various places, arrangements, so to speak, and institutions, have contributed to the comfort and relief of the soldiers. You have two of these places in this city---the Cooper-Shop and Union Volunteer Refreshment Saloons. [Great applause and cheers.] And lastly, these fairs, which, I believe, began only in last August, if I mistake not, in Chicago; then at Boston, at Cincinnati, Brooklyn, New York,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;395</span>
at Baltimore, and those at present held at St. Louis, Pittsburg, and Philadelphia. The motive and object that lie at the bottom of all these are most worthy; for, say what you will, after all the most is due to the soldier, who takes his life in his hands and goes to fight the battles of his country. [Cheers.] In what is contributed to his comfort when he passes to and fro [<span class="rend-i">from city to city</span>], and in what is contributed to him when he is sick and wounded, in whatever shape it comes, whether from the fair and tender hand of woman, or from any other source, is much, very much; but, I think there is still that which has as much value to him [<span class="rend-i">in the continual reminders he sees in the newspapers, that while he is absent he is yet remembered by the loved ones at home</span>---he is not forgotten. [Cheers.] Another view of these various institutions is worthy of consideration, I think; they are voluntary contributions, given freely, zealously, and earnestly, on top of all the disturbances of business, [<span class="rend-i">of all the disorders</span>,] the taxation and burdens that the war has imposed upon us, giving proof that the national resources are not at all exhausted, [cheers;] that the national spirit of patriotism is even [<span class="rend-i">firmer and</span>] stronger than at the commencement of the rebellion [<span class="rend-i">war</span>].</p>
<p>It is a pertinent question often asked in the mind privately, and from one to the other, when is the war to end? Surely I feel as deep [<span class="rend-i">great</span>] an interest in this question as any other can, but I do not wish to name a day, or month, or a year when it is to end. I do not wish to run any risk of seeing the time come, without our being ready for the end, and for fear of disappointment, because the time had come and not the end. [<span class="rend-i">We accepted this war; we did not begin it</span>.] We accepted this war for an object, a worthy object, and the war will end when that object is attained. Under God, I hope it never will until that time. [Great cheering.] Speaking of the present campaign, General Grant is reported to have said, I am going through on this line if it takes all summer. [Cheers.] This war has taken three years; it was begun or accepted upon the line of restoring the national authority over the whole national domain, and for the American people, as far as my knowledge enables me to speak, I say we are going through on this line if it takes three years more. [Cheers.] My friends, I did not know but that I might be called upon to say a few words before I got away from here, but I did not know it was coming just here. [Laughter.] I have never been in the habit of making predictions in regard to the war, but I am almost tempted to make one. [(Do <span class="rend-i">it---do it!</span>)]---If I were to hazard it, it is this: That Grant is this evening, with General Meade and General Hancock, of Pennsylvania, and the brave officers<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;396</span>
and soldiers with him, in a position from whence he will never be dislodged until Richmond is taken [loud cheering], and I have but one single proposition to put now, and, perhaps, I can best put it in form of an interrogative [<span class="rend-i">interragatory</span>]. If I shall discover that General Grant and the noble officers and men under him can be greatly facilitated in their work by a sudden pouring forward [<span class="rend-i">forth</span>] of men and assistance, will you give them to me? [Cries of ``yes.''] Then, I say, stand ready, for I am watching for the chance. [Laughter and cheers.] I thank you, gentlemen.</p>

<p>I thank you, sir, for your kind words of welcome. I am happy at the opportunity of visiting the Union League of Philadelphia, the first, I believe, of the Union Leagues---an organization free from political prejudices, and prompted in its formation by motives of the highest patriotism. I have many a time heard of its doing great good, and no one has charged it with doing any wrong. But it is not my intention to make a speech. My object in visiting Philadelphia was exclusively to witness the Sanitary Fair, and I need scarcely say that I have been more than delighted in witnessing the extraordinary efforts of your patriotic men and lovely ladies in behalf of the suffering soldiers and sailors of our country. It will now afford me pleasure to take each of you by the hand.</p>

I feel confident he has not meant wrong, and I shall be glad for you to do the best for him you can, consistently with law &amp; the good of the service. Yours truly</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS, IHi. On August 5, 1864, Cyrenius B. Denio wrote Lincoln from Chicago:</p>
<p>``As you will see by the heading of this letter I am not on the Pacific Coast, but here on my old stomping ground.</p>
<p>``After I saw you in June I remained for some days trying to do something with Sec Wells by which I could in some way be reimbursed for the large outlay of money in coming to the Federal City to lay my matters before the Department. But while Mr Wells seemed disposed to do all he <span class="rend-i">could</span> for me without setting a `dangerous precedent,' still I thought that certain influences were brought to bear upon him that would prevent him from doing as I thought right, and wrote him a letter on the 24th of June tendering him my resignation, and in a few moments called upon him for an acceptance of my resignation in writing, and at his request withdrew it and agreed to return to San Francisco, but was taken sick in Chicago and could not return. As soon as able I telegraphed to Sec. Wells for permission to proceed there and attend investigation on those charges and was by him instructed to remain as it was `too late,' and advised to `wait.' I have since written to the Secretary and enclosed to him some additional Testimony as to the wrongs that are being perpetrated by men on the Navy Yard at Mare Island, and really think when the matter is all looked at that I will receive orders to return to the Yard and resume my duties as Master Mason. I do not know but I was mistaken in trying to be <span class="rend-i">honest</span> but I do not yet believe it. . . .</p>
<p>``I feel in this matter as if my <span class="rend-i">honor</span> was at stake. I owe it to myself, &amp; to my country to be reinstated with the power to live an honest man, and still be <span class="rend-i">safe</span> in my position! For I tell you Mr Lincoln a man who will not steal when he has a chance from his Government loses <span class="rend-i">caste</span> on that Navy Yard as things are now. Thus far I have said nothing to any one about my wrongs on the Pacific Coast nor do I propose to yet, but I <span class="rend-i">must</span> have them righted if I wait until the 1st of Dec. when Congress assembles. . . .''

I am well satisfied with Judge Kelly as an M.C. and I do not know that the man who might supplant him would be as satisfactory; but the correct principle, I think, is that all our friends should have absolute freedom of choice among our friends.

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy, DLC-RTL. On June 17, 1864, Stanton had written Bates as follows: ``This Department has been informed that one or more regiments of colored persons who were free on the 19th day of April, 1861, have been enlisted and mustered into the military service of the United States, between . . . December 1862 and the 15th of June 1864, and are now in that service. The Fourth section of the act . . . approved June 15th 1864, provides that all persons of the class above mentioned, shall receive the pay bounty and clothing, allowed to such persons by the laws existing at the time of their enlistment, and the Attorney General of the United States is authorized to determine any question of law arising under this provision. A question has arisen under the aforesaid provision, in reference to what pay bounty and clothing are allowed by law to persons of color who were free on the 19th day of April 1861, and who have been enlisted. . . . I therefore respectfully and pursuant to the aforesaid provision of the Act of Congress, submit this question to your determination. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;405</span></p>
<p>On June 24 Stanton submitted to Lincoln, ``a paper returned from the Attorney General's Office, purporting to be a reply, but having no signature. It is of great importance that the points submitted by me for the determination of the Attorney General, pursuant to the Act of Congress, should be speedily decided; and I would therefore respectfully ask that, inasmuch as the efforts of this Department have failed, you would procure from the Attorney General a determination of the question submitted in my letter, in order that the Department may proceed to make payment to the colored troops without delay, in accordance with such determination. . . .'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>.).</p>
<p>The unsigned ``paper,'' dated June 20, 1864, reads in part:</p>
<p>``I had the honor to receive your letter of the 17th . . . with a copy of the act of Congress of June 15, 1864, and a request for my opinion upon a question `<span class="rend-i">in reference to</span> what pay, bounty and clothing is allowed by law, to persons of color who were free on the 19th day of April 1861, and who have been enlisted and mustered into the military service of the United States, between the month of December 1862, and the 16th of June 1864.'</p>
<p>``I confess myself at a loss to know (so as to answer satisfactorily to myself) the precise meaning of the question, or the precise point upon which a doubt exists in your Department, as to the amount of pay, bounty and clothing of the persons indicated, under laws passed prior to the 15th of June 1864.</p>
<p>``I am the more induced to desire a specific statement of the question, because the 4th section of the act (of June 15 1864) to which you refer, is very peculiar in its phraseology. It does not give, or purport to give to the class of troops indicated, anything whatever, to which they had not a perfect right, by prior laws. It provides only that they shall `be entitled to receive the pay, bounty and clothing allowed to such persons <span class="rend-i">by the laws existing at the time of their enlistment</span>.' it seems to me therefore that any question as to the amount of pay, bounty and clothing to be paid to such troops, must, of necessity arise under the previous laws, and not under the act of June 15, 1864. And I should be ready to comply, with alacrity, with your request for an opinion upon any specific question of law, arising under any of those prior acts.</p>
<p>``But the said 4th section is very peculiar, in another respect. It does not require the Attorney General to give any <span class="rend-i">opinion</span> to any officer. . . . it goes far beyond that. It purports to make him a final judge of the matter, by enacting that `the Attorney General . . . is <span class="rend-i">hereby authorized to determine</span> any question of law arising under <span class="rend-i">this provision</span>'. . . . And this is clearly a new and special delegation of power, to hear and determine questions of law, without and beyond the general duty of the Attorney General to give opinion and advice. . . .</p>
<p>``I make these suggestions . . . upon the supposition that there may be questions arising under the acts prior to that of June 15, 1864 . . . if so, you will be pleased to direct the question to be so stated as to enable me to give direct and specific answers, which I will endeavor to do, with all convenient speed. . . .'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>.).</p>
<p>On July 14, Bates answered Lincoln's letter of June 24:</p>
<p>``By your communication of the 24th ultimo you require my opinion in writing as to what amounts of pay, bounty, and clothing are allowed by law to persons of color who were free on the 19th day of April, 1861, and who have been enlisted and mustered into the military service . . . between . . . December, 1862, and the 16th of June, 1864. I suppose that whatever doubt or difficulty may exist . . . has mainly its origin in the . . . provisions of the act of July 17, 1862, chapter 201. . . . The twelfth section of that statute provides: `That the President be . . . authorized to receive into the service of the United States, for the purpose of constructing intrenchments or performing camp service, or any other labor, or any military or naval service for which they may be found competent, persons of African descent. . . .' The fifteenth section . . . enacts that `persons . . . who, under this law, shall be employed, shall receive $10 per month and one ration, $3 of which monthly pay may be in clothing.' The first and main<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;406</span>
question, therefore, is whether the persons of color referred to in your letter . . . are . . . employed under the statute of July 17, 1862. . . . If they are not thus employed, their compensation should not be governed . . . by . . . the fifteenth section of that statute. . . .</p>
<p>``Now, I think that it is clear . . . that those persons of color who have voluntarily enlisted and have been mustered into our military service . . . who have done and are doing in the field and in garrison the duty and service of soldiers of the United States, are not persons . . . employed under the statute to which I have referred. . . .</p>
</div>
<a name=""></a><div class="textindentlevelx" id="">
<p>give it to you unhesitatingly as my opinion that the same pay, bounty, and clothing are allowed by law to the persons of color referred to in your communication . . . as are, by the laws existing at the times of the enlistments of said persons, authorized and provided for and allowed to other soldiers in the volunteer services of the United States of like arms of the service. . . .'' (OR, III, IV, 490-93).</p>
<p>With this letter as printed in the <span class="rend-i">Official Records</span> is Stanton's endorsement referring it to the adjutant general with instructions to direct the paymaster general to pay colored troops in accordance with Bates' opinion.</p>

<div class="opener">Hon. W. C. Bryant Executive Mansion,<br>
My dear Sir. Washington, June 27. 1864.</div>
<p>Yours of the 25th. has just been handed me by the Secretary of the Navy. The tone of the letter, rather than any direct statement in it, impresses me as a complaint that Mr. Henderson should have been removed from office, and arrested; coupled with the single suggestion that he be restored, if he shall establish his innocence. I know absolutely nothing of the case except as follows---Monday last Mr. Welles came to me with the letter of dismissal already written, saying he thought proper to show it to me before sending it. I asked him the charges, which he stated in a general way. With as much emphasis as I could I said ``<span class="rend-i">Are you entirely certain of his guilt</span>'' He answered that he was, to which I replied ``Then send the letter.'' Whether Mr. Henderson was a supporter of my second nomination I neither knew, or enquired, or even thought of. I shall be very glad indeed if he shall, as you anticipate, establish his innocence; or, to state it more strongly and properly, ``if the government shall fail to establish his guilt.'' I believe however, the man<span class="ptr"><a name="7_409_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_409_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> who made the affidavit was of as spotless reputation as Mr. Henderson, until he was arrested on what his friends insist was outrageously insufficient evidence. I know the entire city government<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;410</span>
of Washington, with many other respectable citizens, appealed to me in his behalf, as a greatly injured gentleman.</p>
<p>While the subject is up may I ask whether the Evening Post has not assailed me for supposed too lenient dealing with persons charged of fraud &amp; crime? and that in cases of which the Post could know but little of the facts? I shall certainly deal as leniently with Mr. Henderson as I have felt it my duty to deal with others, notwithstanding any newspaper assaults. Your Obt. Servt.</p>

<p>``Mr. Isaac Henderson, who acts as publisher of the Evening Post, has been summarily dismissed from the office of Navy Agent, which he has held for the last three years, and at the same time, arrested by the officials of your administration, on a charge . . . of infamous frauds on the government. . . .</p>
<p>```I am satisfied that Mr. Henderson will establish his entire innocence at the examination, and you will allow me frankly but respectfully to say, that I should not bear towards you the esteem that I do, did I not feel equally confident, that, in that event, your sense of justice will lead you to reinstate him in office without delay. . . . I cannot bear that the least shadow of the suspicion of corrupt or even questionable practices should rest upon any person, in any way connected with the Evening Post.</p>
<p>``What makes these severe proceedings still more unkind is, that Mr. Henderson has always zealously supported your administration, that he has used all his influence in its favor, and that he desired and has approved your second nomination. Of course no astonishment that he ever felt could equal his, at being so roughly treated by a government which in his mind had always been associated with the idea of fairness and equity.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>Gideon Welles' <span class="rend-i">Diary</span> records under date of June 27, 1864: ``I have a very earnest letter to-day from William C. Bryant in behalf his partner and publisher, Henderson. It was handed to me by Mr. [Moses F.] Odell . . . inclosed was also an open letter to the President, which he wished me to deliver. Mr. O. is, like H., a prominent member of the Methodist Church. They are of opposite politics. Of course Mr. H. stimulated Mr. B. to write these letters, and, having got them, sends them through his religious associate. Mr. B. evidently believes H. innocent and injured. This is natural. Odell knows he is not. Morgan believes that both Bryant and [Parke] Godwin are participants in the plunder of Henderson. I have doubts as regards B., who is feeling very badly, and thinks there is a conspiracy in which Seward and Thurlow Weed are chiefs. I am supposed to be an instrument in their hands, and so is the President. But it so happens that neither of them knew any of the facts until the arrest of Henderson and his removal were ordered. . . .''</p>
<p>Bryant replied on June 30:</p>
<p>``I thank you for the attention you have given to my letter. It confirms my convictions of your equity and love of justice.</p>
<p>``You speak of having been assailed in the Evening Post. I greatly regret that any thing said of your public conduct in that journal should seem to you like an assault, or in any way the indication of hostility. It was not intended to proceed beyond the bounds of respectful criticism, such as the Evening Post, ever since I have had any thing to do with it, has always permitted itself to use tow[ard] every successive administration of the government. Nor have I done you the wrong of supposing that any freedom of remark would make you forget what was due to justice and right. . . .''</p>

Please cause a copy to be made.'' (ALS, DNA WR RG 107, Presidential Telegrams, I, 79). The copy dated June 14, 1864, and bearing the names of delegates to the convention was forwarded by Curtis:</p>
<p>``The National Union Convention which assembled in Baltimore on the 7th of June 1864 has instructed us to inform you that you were nominated with enthusiastic unanimity for the Presidency of the United States for four years from the fourth of March next.</p>
<p>``The resolutions of the Convention which we have already had the honor of placing in your hands, are a full and clear statement of the principles which inspired its action, and which, as we believe, the great body of Union men in the country heartily approve. Whether those resolutions express the national gratitude to our soldiers and sailors; or the national scorn of compromise with rebels and consequent dishonor; or the patriotic duty of union and success; whether they approve the proclamation of emancipation, the constitutional amendment, the employment of former slaves as union soldiers, or the solemn obligation of<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;412</span>
the Government promptly to redress the wrongs of every soldier of the union of whatever color or race; whether they declare the inviolability of the pledged faith of the nation, or offer the national hospitality to the oppressed of every land, or urge the union by railroad of the Atlantic &amp; Pacific oceans; whether they recommend public economy &amp; vigorous taxation, or assert the fixed popular opposition to the establishment by armed force of foreign monarchies in the immediate neighborhood of the United States, or declare that those only are worthy of official trust who approve unreservedly the views &amp; policy indicated in the resolutions,---they were equally hailed with the heartiness of profound conviction.</p>
<p>``Believing with you, Sir, that this is the people's war for the maintenance of a government which you have justly described as `of the people, by the people, for the people' we are very sure that you will be glad to know not only from the resolutions themselves, but from the singular harmony &amp; enthusiasm with which they were adopted how warm is the popular welcome of every measure in the prosecution of the war which is as vigorous, unmistakeable &amp; unfaltering as the national purpose itself. No right, for instance, is so precious and sacred to the American heart as that of personal liberty. Its violation is regarded with just, instant &amp; universal jealousy. Yet in this hour of peril every faithful citizen concedes that, for the sake of national existence and the common welfare, individual liberty may, as the Constitution provides in case of rebellion, be sometimes summarily constrained, asking only with painful anxiety, that, in every instance and to the least detail, that absolutely necessary power shall not be hastily or unwisely exercised.</p>
<p>``We believe, Sir, that the honest will of the Union men of the country was never more truly represented than in this Convention. Their purpose we believe to be the overthrow of armed rebels in the field, and the security of permanent peace and union by liberty and justice under the Constitution. That these results are to be achieved amid cruel perplexities, they are fully aware. That they are to be reached only by cordial unanimity of counsel, is undeniable. That good men may sometimes differ as to the means and the time, they know. That in the conduct of all human affairs the highest duty is to determine in the angry conflict of passion, how much good may be practically accomplished, is their sincere persuasion. They have watched your official course, therefore, with unflagging attention; and amid the bitter taunts of eager friends and the fierce denunciation of enemies; now moving too fast for some, now too slowly for others, they have seen you throughout this tremendous test patient, sagacious, faithful, just, leaning upon the heart of the great mass of the people, and satisfied to be moved by its mighty pulsations.</p>
<p>``It is for this reason that long before the Convention met the popular instinct had plainly indicated you as its candidate, and the Convention, therefore, merely recorded the popular will. Your character &amp; career prove your unswerving fidelity to the cardinal principles of American Liberty and of the American Constitution. In the name of that Liberty and Constitution, Sir, we earnestly request your acceptance of this nomination; reverently commending our beloved country, and you its chief magistrate, with all its brave sons who on sea and land are faithfully defending the good old American cause of equal rights, to the blessing of Almighty God.''

Hon. Secretary of the Treasury Washington DC.<br>
My dear Sir: June 28. 1864</div>
<p>When I received your note this forenoon suggesting a verbal conversation in relation to the appointment of a successor to Mr. Cisco, I hesitated because the difficulty does not, in the main part, lie within the range of a conversation between you and me. As the proverb goes, no man knows so well where the shoe pinches as he who wears it. I do not think Mr. Field a very proper man for the place, but I would trust your judgment, and forego this, were the greater difficulty out of the way. Much as I personally like Mr. Barney, it has been a great burden to me to retain him in his place, when nearly all our friends in New-York, were directly or indirectly, urging his removal. Then the apointment of Judge Hogeboom to be general Appraiser, brought me to and has ever since kept me<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;414</span>
at, the verge of open revolt. Now, the appointment of Mr. Field would precipitate me in it, unless Senator Morgan and those feeling as he does, could be brought to concur in it. Strained as I already am at this point I do not think I can make this appointment in the direction of still greater strain.</p>
<p>The testimonials of Mr. Field, with your accompanying notes, were duly received, and I am now waiting to see your answer from Mr. Cisco. Yours truly A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>Upon receiving Lincoln's reply, Chase answered: ``I have telegraphed Mr. Cisco begging him to withdraw his resignation and serve at least another quarter. If he declines to do so I must repeat that, in my judgment, the public interests require the appointment of Mr. Field. One of the gentlemen named by Senator Morgan is over seventy &amp; the other, I think, over sixty years old, and neither has any practical knowledge of the duties of the office. They are both estimable gentlemen and were the times peaceful &amp; the business of the office comparatively small &amp; regular, I should gladly acquiesce in the appointment of either. But my duty to you &amp; to the country does not permit it now. I have already after conference with Senator Morgan offered, with his concurrence, my recommendation to your consideration to three gentlemen, each admirably qualified, but each has declined. I now recommend Mr. Field because among those who will take the place I think him best qualified and only for that reason. But, this, especially in these times, should be a controlling reason. . . .'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>.).</p>
<p>John J. Cisco telegraphed Chase on the same day: ``I cannot resist your appeal &amp; therefore consent to the temporary withdrawal of my resignation'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>.).</p>
<p>On June 29, Chase wrote Lincoln enclosing Cisco's telegram and his own letter of resignation, with the following note:</p>
<p>``I have just received your note and have read it with great attention. I was not aware of the extent of the embarrassment to which you refer. In recommendations for office I have sincerely sought to get the best men for the places to be filled without reference to any other classification than supporters and opponents of your administration. Of the latter I have recommended none; among the former I have desired to know no distinction except degrees of fitness.</p>
<p>``The withdrawal of Mr. Cisco's resignation, which I enclose, relieves the present difficulty; but I cannot help feeling that my position here is not altogether agreeable to you; and it is certainly too full of embarrassment and difficulty and painful responsibility to allow in me the least desire to retain it.</p>
<p>``I think it my duty therefore to enclose to you my resignation. I shall regard it as a real relief if you think proper to accept it; and will most cheerfully tender to my successor any aid he may find useful in entering upon his duties.'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>.)</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; DS, DLC-RTL. Neither this communication nor Usher's report was ever sent to the Senate. Usher's report of June 29 is as follows:</p>
<p>``On the 25th of March last the Senate passed a resolution in the following words, viz: `Resolved, That the President of the United States be requested to furnish to the Senate the Report of the Commissioner of Emigration for 1863, with his account of the existing contracts and other necessary information on the question of emigration.' This resolution you referred to this Department, with a request for the report therein called for. In reply, I have the honor to state, that I am not aware of the existence of any such office as that of `Commissioner of Emigration,' and consequently that no such official document as that alluded to by the resolution of the Senate has been or could have been made.</p>
<p>``On the 11th of March last, I had the honor to submit to you a report, in answer to a resolution adopted by the Senate, in January of the present year, requesting you to inform the Senate, if not in your opinion incompatible with the public interest, whether any portion of the appropriations for the colonization of persons of African descent, residing in the District of Columbia, in Hayti, Liberia, and so forth, had been expended, and what steps had been taken to execute the provisions of the Acts of Congress relating to colonization. In consequence of the importance which had been attached to the subject, I availed myself of that occasion to lay before you the entire correspondence of the Department on the subject of colonization, together with copies of all the contracts or agreements which had been made, and an abstract of the expenditures which had been incurred up to that date. That report was promptly communicated by you to the Senate, but has not yet been printed, so far as I am informed. No further agreements have since been entered into, and no further efforts made, looking to the colonization of persons of African descent beyond the limits of the United States; so that the Senate, by the official report from this Department, of March 11, 1864, before referred to, is in possession of all the official<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;418</span>

<p>By the President of the United States of America:</p>
<p>A Proclamation.</p>
<p>Whereas, by a proclamation which was issued on the 15th. day of April, 1861, the President of the United States announced and declared that the laws of the United States had been for some time past and then were opposed and the execution thereof obstructed in certain States therein mentioned by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the powers vested in the Marshals by law;</p>
<p>And whereas, immediately after the issuing of the said proclamation the land and naval forces of the United States were put into activity to suppress the said insurrection and rebellion;</p>
<p>And whereas, the Congress of the United States by an act approved on the 3d. day of March 1863, did enact that during the said rebellion, the President of the United States, whenever in his judgment the public safety may require it, is authorized to suspend the privilege of the writ of Habeas Corpus in any case throughout the United States or in any part thereof;</p>
<p>And whereas the said insurrection and rebellion still continue, endangering the existence of the Constitution and Government of the United States;</p>
<p>And whereas the military forces of the United States are now actively engaged in suppressing the said insurrection and rebellion, in various parts of the States where the said rebellion has been successful in obstructing the laws and public authorities, especially in the States of Virginia and Georgia;</p>
<p>And whereas on the fifteenth day of September last, the President of the United States duly issued his proclamation, wherein he declared that the privilege of the writ of Habeas Corpus should be suspended throughout the United States in the cases where, by the authority of the President of the United States, military, naval and civil officers of the United States or any of them hold persons under their command or in their custody either as prisoners of war, spies, or aiders or abettors of the enemy; or officers, soldiers or seamen enrolled or drafted or mustered or enlisted in or belonging to the land or naval forces of the United States or as deserters therefrom or otherwise amenable to military law or the Rules and Articles of War or the rules or regulations prescribed for the military<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;426</span>
or naval services by authority of the President of the United States or for resisting a draft or for any other offence against the military or naval service;</p>
<p>And whereas many citizens of the State of Kentucky have joined the forces of the insurgents and such insurgents have on several occasions entered the said State of Kentucky in large force, and not without aid and comfort furnished by disaffected and disloyal citizens of the United States residing therein, have not only greatly disturbed the public peace but have overborne the civil authorities and made flagrant civil war, destroying property and life in various parts of that State; and whereas it has been made known to the President of the United States by the officers commanding the national armies, that combinations have been formed in the said State of Kentucky with a purpose of inciting rebel forces to renew the said operations of civil war within the said State, and thereby to embarrass the United States armies now operating in the said States of Virginia and Georgia and even to endanger their safety:</p>
<p>Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the constitution and laws, do, hereby, declare that in my judgment the public safety especially requires that the suspension of the privilege of the writ of Habeas Corpus so proclaimed in the said proclamation of the 15th. of September, 1863, be made effectual and be duly enforced in and throughout the said State of Kentucky, and that martial law be for the present established therein. I do, therefore, hereby require of the military officers in the said State that the privileges of the writ of Habeas Corpus be effectually suspended within the said State according to the aforesaid proclamation, and that martial law be established therein, to take effect from the date of this proclamation,---the said suspension and establishment of martial law to continue until this proclamation shall be revoked or modified, but not beyond the period when the said rebellion shall have been suppressed or come to an end. And I do hereby require and command, as well all military officers as all civil officers and authorities existing or found within the said State of Kentucky to take notice of this proclamation and to give full effect to the same.</p>
<p>The martial law herein proclaimed and the things in that respect herein ordered will not be deemed or taken to interfere with the holding of lawful elections, or with the proceedings of the constitutional legislature of Kentucky or with the administration of justice in the courts of law existing therein between citizens of the United States in suits or proceedings which do not affect the military<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;427</span>
operations or the constituted authorities of the Government of the United States.</p>
<p>In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>By the President of the United States of America:</p>
<p>A Proclamation.</p>
<p>Whereas, the Senate and House of Representatives at their last Session adopted a Concurrent Resolution, which was approved on the second day of July instant, and which was in the words following, namely:</p>
<p>``That, the President of the United States be requested to appoint a day for humiliation and prayer by the people of the United States; that he request his constitutional advisers at the head of the executive departments to unite with him as Chief Magistrate of the Nation, at the City of Washington, and the members of Congress, and all magistrates, all civil, military and naval officers,---all soldiers, sailors, and marines, with all loyal and law-abiding people, to convene at their usual places of worship, or wherever they may be, to confess and to repent of their manifold sins; to implore the compassion and forgiveness of the Almighty, that, if consistent with His will, the existing rebellion may be speedily suppressed, and the supremacy of the Constitution and laws of the United States may be established throughout all the States; to implore Him as the Supreme Ruler of the World, not to destroy us as a people, nor suffer us to be destroyed by the hostility or connivance of other Nations, or by obstinate adhesion to our own counsels, which may be in conflict with His eternal purposes, and to implore Him to enlighten the mind of the Nation to know and do His will; humbly believing that it is in accordance with His will that our place should be maintained as a united people among the family of nations; to implore Him to grant to our armed defenders and the masses of the people that courage, power of resistance and endurance necessary to secure that result; to implore Him in His infinite goodness to soften the hearts, enlighten the minds, and quicken the consciences of those in rebellion, that they may lay<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;432</span>
down their arms and speedily return to their allegiance to the United States, that they may not be utterly destroyed, that the effusion of blood may be stayed, and that unity and fraternity may be restored, and peace established throughout all our borders.''</p>
<p>Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, cordially concurring with the Congress of the United States in the penitential and pious sentiments expressed in the aforesaid Resolution, and heartily approving of the devotional design and purpose thereof, do, hereby, appoint the first Thursday of August next, to be observed by the People of the United States as a day of national humiliation and prayer.</p>
<p>I do, hereby, further invite and request the Heads of the Executive Departments of this Government, together with all Legislators,---all Judges and Magistrates, and all other persons exercising authority in the land, whether civil, military or naval,---and all soldiers, seamen and marines in the national service,---and all the other loyal and law-abiding People of the United States, to assemble in their preferred places of public worship on that day, and there and then to render to the Almighty and Merciful Ruler of the Universe, such homages and such confessions, and to offer to Him such supplications, as the Congress of the United States have, in their aforesaid Resolution, so solemnly, so earnestly, and so earnestly, and so reverently recommended.</p>
<p>In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>``I venture to inclose you a letter and telegraphic dispatch that I received yesterday from our irrepressible friend, Colorado Jewett, at Niagara Falls. I think they deserve attention. Of course, I do not indorse Jewett's positive averment that his friends . . . have `full powers' from J.D., though I do not doubt that <span class="rend-i">he</span> thinks they have. I let that statement stand as simply evidencing the anxiety of the Confederates everywhere for peace. So much is beyond doubt.</p>

And a wide-spread conviction that the Government . . . are not anxious for Peace, and do not improve proffered opportunities to achieve it, is doing great harm now, and is morally certain, unless removed, to do far greater in the approaching Elections. . . .</p>

<p>``I would give the safe conduct required by the Rebel envoys at Niagara . . . but <span class="rend-i">you</span> may see reasons for declining it. But, whether through them or otherwise, do not, I entreat you, fail to make the Southern people comprehend that you and all of us are anxious for peace. . . .</p>

With United States stocks worth but forty cents in gold per dollar, and drafting about to commence on the third million of Union soldiers, can this be wondered at?</p>
<p>``I do not say that a just peace is now attainable, though I believe it to be so. But I <span class="rend-i">do</span> say, that a frank <span class="rend-i">offer</span> by you to the insurgents of terms . . . will . . . prove an immense and sorely needed advantage to the national cause; it may save us from a northern insurrection. . . .</p>

<p>Your despatch to Gen. Halleck, referring to what I may think in the present emergency, is shown me. Gen. Halleck says we have absolutely no force here fit to go to the field.

What we shall get in from Penn. &amp; N.Y. will scarcely [be] worth counting, I fear. Now what I think is that you should provide to retain your hold where you are certainly, and bring the rest with you personally, and make a vigorous effort to destroy the enemie's force in this vicinity. I think there is really a fair chance to do this if the movement is prompt. This is what I think, upon your suggestion, and is not an order A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>Your note of to-day, inclosing Gen. Halleck's letter of yesterday, relative to offensive remarks supposed to have been made by the Post-Master-General concerning the Military officers on duty about Washington, is received. The General's letter, in substance demands of me that if I approve the remarks, I shall strike the names of those officers from the rolls; and that if I do not approve them, the Post-Master-General shall be dismissed from the Cabinet. Whether the remarks were really made I do not know; nor do I suppose such knowledge is necessary to a correct response. If they were made I do <span class="rend-i">not</span> approve them; and yet, under the circumstances, I would not dismiss a member of the Cabinet therefor. I do<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;440</span>
not consider what may have been hastily said in a moment of vexation at so severe a loss, is sufficient ground for so grave a step.

<p>``As there have been for the last few days a large number of officers on duty in and about Washington who have devoted their time and energies night and day, and have periled their lives, in the support of the Government, it is due to them as well as to the War Department that it should be known whether such wholesale denouncement &amp; accusation by a member of the cabinet receives the sanction and approbation of the President. . . .

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS, IaHA; ALS copy, DLC-RTL; copy, DNA WR RG 107, Presidential Telegrams, I, 97. In reply to Lincoln's letter of July 9, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>, Greeley wrote on July 10:</p>
<p>``I have yours of yesterday.</p>
<p>``Whether there be persons at Niagara (or elsewhere) who are empowered to commit the Rebels by negotiations, is a question; but, <span class="rend-i">if</span> there be such, there is no question at all that they would decline to exhibit their credentials to me;<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;441</span>
much more to open their budget and give me their best terms. Green as I may be, I am not quite so verdant as to imagine any thing of the sort. I have neither purpose nor desire to be made a confidant, far less an agent in such negotiations. But I do deeply realize that the Rebel chiefs achieved a most decided advantage in proposing, or pretending to propose, to have A. H. Stephens visit Washington as a peace-maker, and being rudely repulsed. And I am anxious that the ground lost to the National cause by that mistake shall somehow be regained in season for effect on the approaching N. Carolina election.</p>
<p>``I will see if I can get a look into the hand of whomsoever may be at Niagara, though that is a project so manifestly hopeless that I have little heart for it. Still, I shall try.</p>
<p>``Meantime, I wish you would consider the propriety of <span class="rend-i">somehow</span> apprising the people of the South, especially those of North Carolina, that <span class="rend-i">no</span> overture or advance looking to Peace and Reunion has ever been repelled by you, but that such a one would at any time have been cordially received and favorably regarded---and would still be. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>On July 13 Greeley wrote again:</p>
<p>``I have now information on which I can rely that two persons, duly commissioned and empowered to negotiate for peace, are at this moment not far from Niagara Falls, in Canada, and are desirous of conferring with yourself or with such persons as you may appoint and empower to treat with them. Their names, (only given in confidence) are Hon. Clement C. Clay of Alabama, and Hon. Jacob Brown of Mississippi. If you should prefer to meet them in person, they require safe conducts for themselves and for George N. Sanders, who will accompany them. Should you choose to empower one or more persons to treat with them in Canada, they will of course need no safe conduct; but they cannot be expected to exhibit credentials save to commissioners empowered as they are. In negotiating directly with yourself, all grounds of cavil would be avoided; and you would be enabled at all times to act upon the freshest advices of the military situation.</p>
<p>``You will of course understand that I know nothing, and have proposed nothing, as to terms, and that nothing is conceded or taken for granted by the meeting of persons empowered to negotiate for peace. All that is assumed is a mutual desire to terminate this wholesale slaughter if a basis of adjustment can be mutually agreed on. And it seems to me high time that an effort to this end should be made.</p>
<p>``I am of course quite other than sanguine that a Peace can now be made. But I am quite sure that a frank, earnest, anxious <span class="rend-i">effort</span> to terminate the War on favorable terms would immensely strengthen the Government in case of its failure, and would help us in the eyes of the civilized world, which now accuses us of obstinacy and indisposition even to <span class="rend-i">seek</span> a peaceful solution of our sanguinary, devastating conflict.</p>
<p>``Hoping to hear that you have resolved to act in the premises, and to act so promptly that a good influence may even yet be executed on the North Carolina election next month, I remain. . . .'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>.).</p>

<p>I have seen your despatches objecting to agents of Northern States opening recruiting stations near your camps. An act of congress authorizes this, giving the appointment of agents to the States, and not to this Executive government. It is not for the War Department, or myself, to restrain, or modify the law, in it's execution, further than actual necessity may require. To be candid, I was for the passage of the law, not apprehending at the time that it would<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;450</span>
produce such inconvenience to the armies in the field, as you now cause me to fear. Many of the States were very anxious for it, and I hoped that, with their State bounties, and active exertions, they would get out substantial additions to our colored forces, which, unlike white recruits, help us where they come from, as well as where they go to. I still hope advantage from the law; and being a law, it must be treated as such by all of us. We here, will do what we consistently can to save you from difficulties arising out of it.

On July 19 Grant telegraphed Lincoln: ``In my opinion there ought to be an immediate call for, say, 300,000 men to be put in the field in the shortest possible time. The presence of this number of re-enforcements would save the annoyance of raids, and would enable us to drive the enemy from his present front, particularly from Richmond, without attacking fortifications. The enemy now have their last man in the field. Every depletion of their army is an irreparable loss. Desertions from it are now rapid. With the prospect of large additions to our force the desertions would increase. The greater number of men we have the shorter and less sanguinary will be the war.

The following planks are in the Platform---</p>
<p>5. The war to be further prossecuted only to restore the <span class="rend-i">Union as it was</span>, and only in such manner, that no further detriment to slave property shall be effected.</p>
<p>6. All negro soldiers and seamen to be at once disarmed and degraded to menial service in the Army and Navy; and no additional negroes to be, on any pretence whatever, taken from their masters.</p>
<p>7 All negroes not having enjoyed actual freedom during the war to be held permanently as slaves; and whether those who shall have enjoyed actual freedom during the war, shall be free to be a legal question.</p>
<p>The following paragraphs are in the Address---</p>
<p>``Let all who are in favor of peace; of arresting the slaughter of our countrymen, of saving the country from bankruptcy &amp; ruin, of securing food &amp; raiment &amp; good wages for the laboring classes; of disappointing the enemies of Democratic &amp; Republican Government who are rejoicing in the overthrow of their proudest monuments; of vindicating our capacity for self-government, arouse and maintain these principles, and elect these candidates.''</p>
<p>``The stupid tyrant who now disgraces the Chair of Washington and Jackson could, any day, have peace and restoration of the Union; and would have them, only that he persists in the war merely to free the slaves.''</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;460</span>The convention may not litterally adopt Mr. Clay's Platform and Address, but we predict it will do so substantially. We shall see.</p>

He also says ``You will find some difficulty in proving that Lincoln could, if he would, have peace and re-union, because Davis has not said so, and will not say so; but you must assert it, and re-assert it, and stick to it, and it will pass as at least half proved.''</p>

My dear Sir: July 25, 1864.</div>
<p>I feel that the subject which you pressed upon my attention in our recent conversation is an important one. The men of the South, recently (and perhaps still) at Niagara Falls, tell us distinctly that they <span class="rend-i">are</span> in the confidential employment of the rebellion; and they tell us as distinctly that they are <span class="rend-i">not</span> empowered to offer terms of peace. Does any one doubt that what they <span class="rend-i">are</span> empowered to do, is to assist in selecting and arranging a candidate and a platform for the Chicago convention? Who could have given them this confidential employment but he who only a week since declared to Jaquess and Gilmore that he had no terms of peace but the independence of the South---the dissolution of the Union? Thus the present presidential contest will almost certainly be no other than a contest between a Union and a Disunion candidate, disunion certainly following the success of the latter. The issue is a mighty one for all people and all time; and whoever aids the right, will be appreciated and remembered. Yours truly A. LINCOLN.</p>

Although marked ``Private,'' Lincoln's letter was obviously intended to be shown to James Gordon Bennett, owner of the New York <span class="rend-i">Herald</span>, whom Lincoln wished to enlist, in so far as possible, in support of his ensuing campaign. That Lincoln's final sentence was meant to convey promise of Bennett's appointment to a post of dignity is borne out of Wakeman's reply as well as by subsequent events leading to Lincoln's offering Bennett the post of minister to France (Lincoln to Bennett, February 20, 1865, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>). On August 12, 1864, Wakeman wrote Lincoln:</p>
<p>``Your excellent letter was duly received. I have read it with proper explanations to Mr B. He said, after some moments of silence, that so far as it related to him, `It did not amount to much.' I supposed, if anything was written, something more specific would be expected. However, I hope to avoid the writing of any thing further. Should it be deemed necessary I will indicate my views as to its form, personally, as I expect to be in Washington next week. I have ventured to show this letter to several of our friends (of course without indicating a word as to what drew it out) and it has met with universal approval.</p>

<p>``I am requested by the Hon Chas Gibson, the Solicitor for the United States in the Court of Claims, to transmit to the President . . . his resignation of that office. I beg that you will place it in the hands of his Excellency.</p>

<p>``I was appointed to office by you at a time when it was deemed advisable for the public welfare, especially in Missouri, to conciliate those---of whom I was one---who did not belong to the party that elected you President, but who obeyed &amp; actively supported you as the duly elected Chief Magistrate of the Nation, and who were unconditionally for the Union. . . .</p>

<p>I have just seen yours, complaining of the appointment of Hovey and Osterhaus. The point you make is unquestionably a good one; and yet please hear a word from us. My recollection is that both Gen. Grant and yourself recommended both H &amp; O. for promotion; and these, with other strong recommendations, drew committals from us which we could neither honorably or safely, disregard. We blamed H. for coming away in the manner in which he did; but we knew he had apparant reason to feel disappointed and mortified, and we felt it was not best to crush one who certainly had been a good soldier. As to O. we did not know of his leaving at the time we made the appointment, and do not now know the terms on which he left. Not to have appointed him, as the case appeared to us at the time, would have been almost if not quite a violation of our word. The word was given on what we thought was high merit, and somewhat on his nationality. I beg you to believe we do not act in a spirit of disregarding merit. We expect to await your programme, for further changes and promotions in your army.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; AES-P, ISLA. Lincoln's endorsement is written on a letter from Governor Andrew G. Curtin forwarding a printed petition, which appeared to him ``just and reasonable.'' The petition is as follows:</p>
<p>``<span class="rend-i">To the Hon. EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War</span>.</p>
<p>``SIR: Twenty thousand Working Women of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, respectfully ask your indulgence, while they narrate the causes which compel them to petition for relief at your hands.</p>
<p>``At the breaking out of the rebellion that is now deluging our land with blood, and which for a time threatened the destruction of the Nation, the prices paid at the United States Arsenal in this city were barely sufficient to enable the women engaged upon Government work to earn a scanty respectable subsistence. Since the period referred to, board, provisions, and all other articles of female consumption, have advanced to such an extent as to make an average of at least seventy-five per cent.,---while woman's labor has been <span class="rend-i">reduced thirty per cent</span>. What need of argument? To an intelligent mind, the result must be apparent; and it is perhaps superfluous to say, that it has produced great suffering, privation, and, in many instances, actual hunger. Such, however, is the <span class="rend-i">truth</span>.</p>
<p>``To alleviate this misery, feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and house the houseless, we appeal to those in authority for a just and reasonable compensation for our labor.</p>
<p>``<span class="rend-i">What we need most</span> IS IMMEDIATE AID. You can give it; the power is lodged with you; issue an Order to the Quartermaster-General, authorizing or ordering him to increase the price of female labor until it shall approximate to the price of living.</p>
<p>``Let it be done without delay. Send the order at once, and you will have the proud satisfaction of knowing that you have done all in your power to ameliorate the condition of those who have given <span class="rend-i">their all</span> to their country; and who now come to that country, not as beggars, asking alms, but as American matrons and daughters, asking an equitable price for their labor. Comply with this, our reasonable request, and hundreds, yea thousands, will rise up and call you blessed.</p>
<p>``We also desire to call your attention to the fact, that there are a large number of men in this city who are making immense fortunes off the Government by their contracts; and who, instead of entering into an honorable competition as to who is willing to work for the smallest profit, seem to go upon the principle, who can pay the lowest prices. We ask you to so modify the contract system as to make it obligatory upon every person taking a contract to pay the Arsenal prices for making the articles for which they put in their bids. This would remedy the evil effectually.</p>
<p>``Lastly, we would respectfully ask your notice of a plan submitted by the Quartermaster of this city to the Quartermaster-General of the United States, about a year ago, urging the attention of the Government to the necessity for increased facilities for manufacturing articles in the Arsenal, whereby four times the number of women now engaged might be employed, and millions of dollars annually saved the Nation.</p>
<p>``Trusting in the generosity of your nature, the justice of our cause, and the claims which our sacrifices have given us, we confidently leave the issue in your hands, praying that the God of the husbandless and fatherless may so incline your heart, that your answer may shed light where all is dark; send joy for sorrow; and sunshine and peace to the thousands that are now bowed down by cloud and storm.</p>
<p>``We have the honor to subscribe ourselves your friends, &amp;c.''</p>

We have tried you, Mr. Bertinatti, as a Charge d' Affaires and as a Minister Resident, and in both of these characters we have found you always sincerely and earnestly interpreting the loyal sentiments of your sovereign. At the same time I am sure that no Minister here has more faithfully maintained and advanced the interests with which he was charged by his Government.

Lincoln's endorsement is written on a letter of Lieutenant Colonel William Blakeley, Fourteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, Harpers Ferry, July 29, 1864, to U.S. Representative Thomas Williams, introducing Major James E. Williams, First New York Veteran Cavalry, who had been dismissed the service without trial, on charges of drunkenness: ``Why not give him a trial? Why not give him an opportunity of meeting his accuser and defending his honor. I ask it as a personal favor to me as an old friend and as one of your constituents, that you will use your influence with the President to procure a trial. . . . This is certainly nothing but justice---he does not desire to be restored to duty without trial. I feel confident that he will be honorably acquited.''

<div class="opener">Executive Mansion, Washington,<br>
Major General Butler: August 9, 1864.</div>
<p>Your paper of the about Norfolk matters is received, as also was your other, on the same general subject dated, I believe some time in February last. This subject has caused considerable trouble, forcing me to give a good deal of time and reflection to it. I regret that crimination and recrimination are mingled in it. I surely need not to assure you that I have no doubt of your loyalty and devoted patriotism; and I must tell you that I have no less confidence in those of Gov. Pierpoint and the Attorney General. The former, at first, as the loyal governor of all Virginia, including that which is now West-Virginia; in organizing and furnishing troops, and in all other proper matters, was as earnest, honest, and efficient to the extent of his means, as any other loyal governor. The inauguration of West-Virginia as a new State left to him, as he assumed, the remainder of the old State; and the insignificance of the parts which are outside of the rebel lines, and consequently within his reach, certainly gives a somewhat farcical air to his dominion; and I suppose he, as well as I, has considered that it could be useful for little else than as a nucleous to add to. The Attorney General only needs to be known to be relieved from all question as to loyalty and thorough devotion to the national cause; constantly restraining as he does, my tendency to clemency for rebels and rebel sympathizers. But he is the Law-Officer of the government, and a believer in the virtue of adhering to law.</p>
<p>Coming to the question itself, the Military occupancy of Norfolk is a necessity with us. If you, as Department commander, find the cleansing of the City necessary to prevent pestilence in your army---street lights, and a fire department, necessary to prevent assassinations and incendiarism among your men and stores---wharfage necessary to land and ship men and supplies---a large pauperism, badly conducted, at a needlessly large expense to the government, and find also that these things, or any of them, are not reasonably well attended to by the civil government, you rightfully may, and must take them into your own hands. But you should do so on your<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;488</span>
own avowed judgment of a military necessity, and not seem to admit that there is no such necessity, by taking a vote of the people on the question. Nothing justifies the suspending of the civil by the military authority, but military necessity, and of the existence of that necessity the military commander, and not a popular vote, is to decide. And whatever is not within such necessity should be left undisturbed. In your paper of February you fairly notified me that you contemplated taking a popular vote; and, if fault there be, it was my fault that I did not object then, which I probably should have done, had I studied the subject as closely as I have since done. I now think you would better place whatever you feel is necessary to be done, on this distinct ground of military necessity, openly discarding all reliance for what you do, on any election. I also think you should so keep accounts as to show every item of money received and how expended.</p>
<p>The course here indicated does not touch the case when the military commander finding no friendly civil government existing, may, under the sanction or direction of the President, give assistance to the people to inaugerate one.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADf, DLC-RTL. This communication was not completed, but see Lincoln to Butler, December 21, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>, in which Lincoln enclosed a copy of his incomplete draft. Lincoln's communications to Peirpoint, August 5, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>, and to Butler, August 20, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>, are concerned with the conflict between Butler's military government in Norfolk and the ``restored'' government under Governor Peirpoint, the temporary capital of which was located at Alexandria. Butler's two reports, February 23 and August 1, 1864, are in the Lincoln Papers. Forty and forty-one pages in length, respectively, they are too long for adequate quotation or extended summary, but the case was simply that both Butler and Peirpoint were trying to govern Norfolk. At a Norfolk election held under Butler's orders, citizens voted to retain martial law rather than to accept Peirpoint's administration, whereupon Butler issued an order staying the civil government and making it subordinate to the military government. On July 30, Edward K. Snead announced that, being the duly elected judge of the First Judicial District of Virginia, he was going to hold court. Butler questioned the legality of Snead's commission and authority and asked Snead whether his court was to be in opposition to or subordinate to the military government. Snead replied, according to Butler, that on the advice of Attorney General Bates, his court would be in opposition to the military government. Butler's reports roundly denounced Peirpoint, Snead, and likewise Bates, for meddling in Norfolk affairs.</p>

Hon. Horace Greeley, Executive Mansion,<br>
Dear Sir: Washington, August 9, 1864.</div>
<p>Herewith is a full copy of the correspondence, and which I have had privately printed, but not made public. The parts of your letters which I wish suppressed, are only those which, as I think, give too gloomy an aspect to our cause, and those which present the carrying of elections as a motive of action. I have, as you see, drawn a red pencil over the parts I wish suppressed.</p>
<p>As to the A. H. Stephens matter, so much pressed by you, I can only say that he sought to come to Washington in the name of the ``Confederate States,'' in a vessel of ``The Confederate States Navy,'' and with no pretence even, that he would bear any proposal for peace; but with language showing that his mission would be Military, and not civil, or diplomatic. Nor has he at any time since pretended that he had terms of peace, so far as I know, or believe. On the contrary, Jefferson Davis has, in the most formal manner, declared that Stephens had no terms of peace. I thought we could not afford to give this quasi acknowledgement of the independence of<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;490</span>
the Confederacy, in a case where there was not even an intimation of any thing for our good. Still, as the parts of your letters relating to Stephens contain nothing worse than a questioning of my action, I do not ask a suppression of those parts. Yours truly</p>

Lincoln enclosed a six-page pamphlet printing of the correspondence, which ended with the following statement: ``The foregoing is absolutely the whole record of the case ever seen by the President.'' (DLC-RTL). The copy of this pamphlet preserved in the Lincoln Papers and the copies enclosed to Greeley and to Raymond (Lincoln to Raymond, August 15, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>) were presumably the only copies printed. The correspondence has been fully presented in Lincoln's preceding letters and the notes thereto, but the passages in Greeley's letters which Lincoln deleted have not been indicated. They are as follows: Greeley to Lincoln, July 7 (see note to Lincoln's letter of July 9, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>---(1) ``And thereupon I venture to remind you that our bleeding, bankrupt, almost dying country also longs for peace; shudders at the prospect of fresh conscriptions, of further wholesale devastations, and of new rivers of human blood. And''; (2) ``now, and is morally certain, unless removed, to do far greater in the approaching elections.''; (3) ``With United States stocks worth but forty cents in gold per dollar, and drafting about to commence on the third million of Union soldiers, can this be wondered at?''; (4) ``it may save us from a northern insurrection.''; Greeley to Lincoln, July 10 (see note to Lincoln's telegram of July 15, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>)---(1) ``in season for effect on the approaching North Carolina election.''; (2) ``especially those of North Carolina,''; Greeley to Lincoln, July 13 (see note to Lincoln's telegram of July 15, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>)---(1) ``so . . . that a good influence may even yet be exerted on the North Carolina election next month.''</p>
<p>On August 11 Greeley replied to Lincoln's letter of August 9:</p>
<p>``I do not feel disposed to let my letters to you go to the public with such suppressions as you indicate by the red pencil marks. I cannot see that <span class="rend-i">you</span> are at all implicated in <span class="rend-i">my</span> anxiety that a generous offer should be made and a kindly spirit evinced in season for effect on the North Carolina election. . . .

Lee and myself for the suppression of insindiaryism by the respective Armies. Experience has taught us that agreements made with rebels are binding upon us but are not observed by them longer than suits their convenience. On the whole I think the best that can be done is to publish a prohibitory order against burning private property except where it is a Military necessity or in retaliation for like acts by the enemy. When burning is done in retaliation it must be done by order of a Dept. or Army Commander and the order for such burning to set forth the particular act it is in retaliation for. Such an order would be published and would come to the knowledge of the rebel Army. I think this course would be much better than any agreement with Gen. Lee. I could publish the order or it could be published by you. This is respectfully submitted for your consideration and I will then act as you deem best.'' (ALS, DLC-Grant Papers).</p>

My dear Sir: Washington, August 17, 1864.</div>
<p>Your letter of the 7th. was placed in my hand yesterday by Gov. Randall.</p>
<p>To me it seems plain that saying re-union and abandonment of slavery would be considered, if offered, is not saying that nothing <span class="rend-i">else</span> or <span class="rend-i">less</span> would be considered, if offered. But I will not stand upon the mere construction of language. It is true, as you remind me, that in the Greeley letter of 1862, I said: ``If I could save the Union without freeing any slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some, and leaving others alone I would also do that.'' I continued in the same letter as follows: ``What I do about slavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause; and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause.'' All this I said in the utmost sincerety; and I am as true to the whole of it now, as when I first said it. When I afterwards proclaimed emancipation, and employed colored soldiers, I only followed the declaration just quoted<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;500</span>
from the Greeley letter that ``I shall do <span class="rend-i">more</span> whenever I shall believe <span class="rend-i">doing</span> more will help the cause'' The way these measures were to help the cause, was not to be by magic, or miracles, but by inducing the colored people to come bodily over from the rebel side to ours. On this point, nearly a year ago, in a letter to Mr. Conkling, made public at once, I wrote as follows: ``But negroes, like other people, act upon motives. Why should they do anything for us if we will do nothing for them? If they stake their lives for us they must be prompted by the strongest motive---even the promise of freedom. And the promise, being made, must be kept.'' I am sure you will not, on due reflection, say that the promise being made, must be <span class="rend-i">broken</span> at the first opportunity. I am sure you would not desire me to say, or to leave an inference, that I am ready, whenever convenient, to join in re-enslaving those who shall have served us in consideration of our promise. As matter of morals, could such treachery by any possibility, escape the curses of Heaven, or of any good man? As matter of policy, to <span class="rend-i">announce</span> such a purpose, would ruin the Union cause itself. All recruiting of colored men would instantly cease, and all colored men now in our service, would instantly desert us. And rightfully too. Why should they give their lives for us, with full notice of our purpose to betray them? Drive back to the support of the rebellion the physical force which the colored people now give, and promise us, and neither the present, nor any coming administration, <span class="rend-i">can</span> save the Union. Take from us, and give to the enemy, the hundred and thirty, forty, or fifty thousand colored persons now serving us as soldiers, seamen, and laborers, and we can not longer maintain the contest. The party who could elect a President on a War &amp; Slavery Restoration platform, would, of necessity, lose the colored force; and that force being lost, would be as powerless to save the Union as to do any other impossible thing. It is not a question of sentiment or taste, but one of physical force, which may be measured, and estimated as horsepower, and steam power, are measured and estimated. And by measurement, it is more than we can lose, and live. Nor can we, by discarding it, get a white force in place of it. There is a witness in every white mans bosom that he would rather go to the war having the negro to help him, than to help the enemy against him. It is not the giving of one class for another. It is simply giving a large force to the enemy, for <span class="rend-i">nothing</span> in return.</p>
<p>In addition to what I have said, allow me to remind you that no one, having control of the rebel armies, or, in fact, having any influence whatever in the rebellion, has offered, or intimated a willingness to, a restoration of the Union, in any event, or on any<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;501</span>
condition whatever. Let it be constantly borne in mind that no such offer has been made or intimated. Shall we be weak enough to allow the enemy to distract us with an abstract question which he himself refuses to present as a practical one? In the Conkling letter before mentioned, I said: ``Whenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the Union, if I shall urge you to continue fighting, it will be an apt time <span class="rend-i">then</span> to declare that you will not fight to free negroes.''<span class="ptr"><a name="7_501_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_501_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> I repeat this now. If Jefferson Davis wishes, for himself, or for the benefit of his friends at the North, to know what I would do if he were to offer peace and re-union, saying nothing about slavery, let him try me.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADf, DLC-RTL. Two drafts are preserved in the Lincoln Papers. The first is in pencil and bears the date as given above. The second is in ink, without date, and is probably the finished copy which Lincoln intended to send, but which he never dated, signed, or sent. The letter from Democratic editor of the Green Bay, Wisconsin, <span class="rend-i">Advocate</span>, Charles D. Robinson, dated August 7, 1864, which First Assistant Postmaster General Alexander W. Randall (formerly governor of Wisconsin) handed to Lincoln on August 16, is as follows:</p>
<p>``I am a War Democrat, and the editor of a Democratic paper. I have sustained your Administration . . . because it is the legally constituted government. I have sustained its war policy, not because I endorsed it entire, but because it presented the only available method of putting down the rebellion. . . . It was alleged that because I and my friends sustained the Emancipation measure, we had become abolitionized. We replied that we regarded the freeing of the negroes as sound war policy, in that the depriving the South of its laborers weakened the . . . Rebellion. That was a good argument. . . . It was solid ground on which we could stand, and still maintain our position as Democrats. We were greatly comforted and strengthened also by your assurance that if your could save the Union without freeing any slave, you would do it; if you could save it by freeing the slaves, you would do it; and if you could do it by freeing some, and leaving others alone, you would also do that.</p>
<p>``The Niagara Falls `Peace' movement was of no importance whatever, except that it resulted in bringing out your declaration, as we understand it, that no steps can be taken towards peace . . . unless accompanied with an abandonment of slavery. This puts the whole war question on a new basis, and takes us War Democrats clear off our feet, leaving us no ground to stand upon. If we sustain the war and war policy, does it not demand the changing of our party politics?</p>
<p>``I venture to write you this letter . . . not for the purpose of finding fault with your policy . . . but in the hope that you may suggest some interpretation of it, as will . . . make it tenable ground on which we War Democrats may stand---preserve our party consistently support the government---and continue to carry also to its support those large numbers of our old political friends who have stood by us up to this time.</p>
<p>``I beg to assure you that this is not written for the purpose of using it, or its possible reply, in a public way. And I . . . send it through my friend Gov. Randall in the belief that he will guarantee for me entire good faith.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>The interview of Randall, Judge Joseph T. Mills, and William P. Dole, with Lincoln on August 19 (<span class="rend-i">infra</span>) presumably dealt with Lincoln's reply to Robinson, although Judge Mills' report of the interview does not mention the letter. In any event, Randall wrote Lincoln on August 22:</p>
<p>``I have been reflecting upon the clause of your letter to Col. Robinson to<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;502</span>
which Mr Dole objected and think there is force in his objection on the score of its policy. While the idea of that part is a correct one, it is unnecessary to say it, I think, because what you say in the balance of the letter will be entirely sufficient for Robinsons purposes. It is not designed for publication it is true, and Mr. Robinson will not publish it. Some accident might get its contents before the public. I presume respectfully to make these suggestions for your consideration.'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>.).</p>
<p>It seems probable, there being no further reference to the letter and no reply from Robinson, that Lincoln decided against sending the letter at all.</p>

<p>SOLDIERS---You are about to return to your homes and your friends, after having, as I learn, performed in camp a comparatively short term of duty in this great contest. I am greatly obliged to you, and to all who have come forward at the call of their country. I wish it might be more generally and universally understood what<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;505</span>
the country is now engaged in. We have, as all will agree, a free Government, where every man has a right to be equal with every other man. In this great struggle, this form of Government and every form of human right is endangered if our enemies succeed. There is more involved in this contest than is realized by every one. There is involved in this struggle the question whether your children and my children shall enjoy the privileges we have enjoyed. I say this in order to impress upon you, if you are not already so impressed, that no small matter should divert us from our great purpose. There may be some irregularities in the practical application of our system.<span class="ptr"><a name="7_505_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln7?id=7_505_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> It is fair that each man shall pay taxes in exact proportion to the value of his property; but if we should wait before collecting a tax to adjust the taxes upon each man in exact proportion with every other man, we should never collect any tax at all. There may be mistakes made sometimes; things may be done wrong while the officers of the Government do all they can to prevent mistakes. But I beg of you, as citizens of this great Republic, not to let your minds be carried off from the great work we have before us. This struggle is too large for you to be diverted from it by any small matter. When you return to your homes rise up to the height of a generation of men worthy of a free Government, and we will carry out the great work we have commenced. I return to you my sincere thanks, soldiers, for the honor you have done me this afternoon.</p>

<p>The President was free &amp; animated in conversation. I was astonished at his elasticity of spirits. Says Gov Randall, why cant you Mr P. seek some place of retirement for a few weeks. You would be reinvigorated. Aye said the President, 3 weeks would do me no good---my thoughts my solicitude for this great country follow me where ever I go. I don't think it is personal vanity, or ambition---but I cannot but feel that the weal or woe of this great nation will be decided in the approaching canvas. My own experience has proven to me, that there is no program intended by the democratic party but that will result in the dismemberment of the Union. But Genl McClellan is in favor of crushing out the rebellion, &amp; he will probably be the Chicago candidate. The slightest acquaintance with arithmetic will prove to any man that the rebel armies cannot be destroyed with democratic strategy. It would sacrifice all the white men of the north to do it. There are now between 1 &amp; 200 thousand black men now in the service of the Union. These men will be<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;507</span>
disbanded, returned to slavery &amp; we will have to fight two nations instead of one. I have tried it. You cannot concilliate the South, when the mastery &amp; control of millions of blacks makes them sure of ultimate success. You cannot concilliate the South, when you place yourself in such a position, that they see they can achieve their independence. The war democrat depends upon conciliation. He must confine himself to that policy entirely. If he fights at all in such a war as this he must economise life &amp; use all the means which God &amp; nature puts in his power. Abandon all the posts now possessed by black men surrender all these advantages to the enemy, &amp; we would be compelled to abandon the war in 3 weeks. We have to hold territory. Where are the war democrats to do it. The field was open to them to have enlisted &amp; put down this rebellion by force of arms, by concilliation, long before the present policy was inaugurated. There have been men who have proposed to me to return to slavery the black warriors of Port Hudson &amp; Olustee to their masters to conciliate the South. I should be damned in time &amp; in eternity for so doing. The world shall know that I will keep my faith to friends &amp; enemies, come what will. My enemies say I am now carrying on this war for the sole purpose of abolition. It is &amp; will be carried on so long as I am President for the sole purpose of restoring the Union. But no human power can subdue this rebellion without using the Emancipation lever as I have done. Freedom has given us the control of 200 000 able bodied men, born &amp; raised on southern soil. It will give us more yet. Just so much it has sub[t]racted from the strength of our enemies, &amp; instead of alienating the south from us, there are evidences of a fraternal feeling growing up between our own &amp; rebel soldiers. My enemies condemn my emancipation policy. Let them prove by the history of this war, that we can restore the Union without it. The President appeared to be not the pleasant joker I had expected to see, but a man of deep convictions &amp; an unutterable yearning for the success of the Union cause. His voice was pleasant---his manner earnest &amp; cordial. As I heard a vindication of his policy from his own lips, I could not but feel that his mind grew in stature like his body, &amp; that I stood in the presence of the great guiding intellect of the age, &amp; that those huge Atlantian shoulders were fit to bear the weight of mightiest monarchies. His transparent honesty, his republican simplicity, his gushing sympathy for those who offered their lives for their country, his utter forgetfulness of self in his concern for his country, could not but inspire me with confidence, that he was Heavens instrument to conduct his people thro this red sea of blood to a Canaan of peace &amp; freedom. Comr. Dole then came in. We<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;508</span>
were about to retire, but he insisted on our remaining longer. Dismissing the present state of the country, he entertained us with reminiscences of the past---of the discussions between himself &amp; Douglass. He said he was accused of of [<span class="rend-i">sic</span>] joking. In his later speeches, the seriousness of the theme prevented him from using anecdotes. Mr. Harris a democratic orator of Ill, once appealed to his audience in this way. If these republicans get into power, the darkies will be allowed to come to the polls &amp; vote. Here comes forward a white man, &amp; you ask him who will you vote for. I will vote for S A Douglass. Next comes up a sleek pampered negro. Well Sambo, who do you vote for. I vote for Massa Lincoln. Now asked the orator, what do you think of that. Some old farmer cried out, I think the darkey showd a damd sight of more sense than the white man. It is such social tete a tetes among his friends that enables Mr Lincoln to endure mental toils &amp; application that would crush any other man. The President now in full flow of spirits, scattered his repartee in all directions. He took his seat on the sofa by my side. Said I Mr President I was in your reception room to day. It was dark. I suppose that clouds &amp; darkness necessarily surround the secrets of state. There in a corner I saw a man quietly reading who possessed a remarkable physiognomy. I was rivetted to the spot. I stood &amp; stared at him He raised his flashing eyes &amp; caught me in the act. I was compelled to speak. Said I, Are you the President. No replied the stranger, I am Frederick Douglass. Now Mr P. are you in favor of miscegenation. That's a democratic mode of producing good Union men, &amp; I dont propose to infringe on the patent. We parted from his Excellency, with firmer purpose to sustain the government, at whose head there stands a man who combines in his person all that is valuable in <span class="rend-i">progress</span> in conservatism---all that is hopeful in <span class="rend-i">progress</span>.</p>

In the <span class="rend-i">Complete Works of Abraham Lincoln</span> (X, 189-91) Nicolay and Hay incorporated a newspaper version purporting to be a verbatim report of Lincoln's remarks on this occasion, which they supplied with the incorrect date ``August [15?] 1864.'' The newspaper version which appeared without date in the New York <span class="rend-i">Tribune</span> for September 10, 1864, was probably prepared by Mills, but with so much adding to and subtracting from the original as to leave something less than an acceptable text of Lincoln's remarks as recorded in the diary. The occasion of the interview is indicated by Lincoln's communication to Charles D. Robinson, August 17, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>.</p>

I almost always feel inclined, when I happen to say anything to soldiers, to impress upon them in a few brief remarks the importance of success in this contest. It is not merely for to-day, but for all time to come that we should perpetuate for our children's children this great and free government, which we have enjoyed all our lives. I beg you to remember this, not merely for my sake, but for yours. I happen temporarily to occupy this big White House. I am a living witness that any one of your children may look to come here as my father's child has. It is in order that each of you may have through this free government which we have enjoyed, an open field and a fair chance for your industry, enterprise and intelligence; that you may all have equal privileges in the race of life, with all its desirable human aspirations. It is for this the struggle should be maintained, that we may not lose our birthright---not only for one, but for two or three years.

The original autograph is endorsed on the verso with autograph signatures of cabinet members and Lincoln's autograph date. A signed copy formerly in the papers of Gideon Welles is in the handwriting of Lincoln's secretary to sign land patents, Edward D. Neill, appointed on August 23, 1864, after having actually served for some time in that capacity while second class clerk in the Department of the Interior. A third copy in John Hay's handwriting, not signed by Lincoln, but endorsed on the verso with autograph signatures of the members of the cabinet, is preserved in the Lincoln Papers (DLC).</p>
<p>John Hay's <span class="rend-i">Diary</span> records under date of November 11, 1864, the cabinet meeting of that date at which the memorandum was opened, following which, presumably, the later copies were transcribed:</p>
<p>``At the meeting of the Cabinet today, the President took out a paper from his desk and said, `Gentlemen, do you remember last summer when I asked you all to sign your names to the back of a paper of which I did not show you the inside? This is it. Now, Mr Hay, see if you can get this open without tearing it?' He had pasted it up in so singular style that it required some cutting to get it open. He then read as follows: [memorandum]</p>
<p>``The President said, `You will remember that this was written at a time (6 days before the Chicago nominating Convention) when as yet we had no adversary, and seemed to have no friends. I then solemnly resolved on the course of action indicated above. I resolved, in case of the election of General McClellan, being certain that he would be the candidate, that I would see him and talk matters over with him. I would say, ``General, the election has demonstrated that you are stronger, have more influence with the American people than I. Now let us together, you with your influence and I with all the executive power of the Government, try to save the country. You raise as many troops as you possibly can for this final trial, and I will devote all my energies to assisting and finishing the war.'' '</p>
<p>``Seward said, `And the General would answer you ``Yes, Yes;'' and the next day when you saw him again and pressed these views upon him, he would say, ``Yes, Yes;'' &amp; so on forever, and would have done nothing at all.'</p>
<p>`` `At least,' added Lincoln, `I should have done my duty and have stood clear before my own conscience.' . . . .''</p>
<p>The impulse which prompted Lincoln to his unusual procedure in preparing the memorandum derived from the unanimous pessimism of his advisers. Thurlow Weed wrote to Seward on August 22:</p>
<p>``When, ten or eleven days since, I told Mr Lincoln that his re-election was an impossibility, I also told him that the information would soon come to him through other channels. It has doubtless, ere this, reached him. At any rate, nobody here doubts it; nor do I see any body from other States who authorises the slightest hope of success.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;515</span>``Mr. Raymond, who has, just left me, says that unless some prompt and bold step be now taken, all is lost.</p>
<p>``The People are wild for Peace. They are told that the President will only listen to terms of Peace on condition Slavery be `abandoned.'</p>
<p>``Mr. Swett is well informed in relation to the public sentiment. He has seen and heard much. Mr Raymond thinks commissioners should be immediately sent, to Richmond, offering to treat for Peace on the basis of Union. That <span class="rend-i">something</span> should be done and promptly done, to give the Administration a chance for its life, is certain.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADf, DLC-RTL. Lincoln endorsed the envelope in which the draft was filed, ``H. J. Raymond --- about peace.'' On August 22 Raymond wrote Lincoln:</p>
<p>``I feel compelled to drop you a line concerning the political condition of the country as it strikes me. I am in active correspondence with your staunchest<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;518</span>
friends in every state and from them all I hear but one report. The tide is setting strongly against us. Hon. E. B. Washburne writes that `were an election to be held now in Illinois we should be beaten.' Mr. Cameron writes that Pennsylvania is against us. Gov. Morton writes that nothing but the most strenuous efforts can carry Indiana. This state, according to the best information I can get, would go 50,000 against us to-morrow. And so of the rest. Nothing but the most resolute and decided action on the part of the government and its friends, can save the country from falling into hostile hands.</p>
<p>``Two special causes are assigned to this great reaction in public sentiment,---the want of military successes, and the impression in some minds, the fear and suspicion in others, that we are not to have peace <span class="rend-i">in any event</span> under this administration until Slavery is abandoned. In some way or other the suspicion is widely diffused that we <span class="rend-i">can</span> have peace with Union if we would. It is idle to reason with this belief---still more idle to denounce it. It can only be expelled by some authoritative act, at once bold enough to fix attention and distinct enough to defy incredulity &amp; challenge respect.</p>
<p>``Why would it not be wise, under these circumstances, to appoint a Commissioner, in due form, <span class="rend-i">to make distinct proffers of peace to Davis</span>, as <span class="rend-i">the head of the rebel armies, on the sole condition of acknowledging the supremacy of the constitution</span>,---all other questions to be settled in a convention of the people of all the States? The making of such an offer would require no armistice, no suspension of active war, no abandonment of positions, no sacrifice of consistency.</p>
<p>``If the proffer were <span class="rend-i">accepted</span> (which I presume it would not be,) the country would never consent to place the practical execution of its details in any but loyal hands, and in those we should be safe.</p>
<p>``If it should be <span class="rend-i">rejected</span>, (as it would be,) it would plant seeds of disaffection in the south, dispel all the delusions about peace that prevail in the North, silence the clamors &amp; damaging falsehoods of the opposition, take the wind completely out of the sails of the Chicago craft, reconcile public sentiment to the War, the draft, &amp; the tax as inevitable <span class="rend-i">necessities</span>, and unite the North as nothing since firing on Fort Sumter has hitherto done.</p>
<p>``I cannot conceive of any answer which Davis could give to such a proposition which would not strengthen you &amp; the Union cause <span class="rend-i">everywhere</span>. Even your radical friends could not fail to applaud it when they should see the practical strength it would bring to the common cause.</p>
<p>``I beg you to excuse the earnestness with which I have pressed this matter upon your attention. It seems to me calculated to do good---&amp; incapable of doing harm. It will turn the tide of public sentiment &amp; avert pending evils of the gravest character. It will rouse &amp; concentrate the loyalty of the country &amp;, unless I am greatly mistaken, give us an early &amp; a fruitful victory.</p>
<p>``Permit me to add that if done at all I think this should be done at once,---as your own spontaneous act. In advance of the Chicago Convention it might render the action of that body, of very little consequence.</p>
<p>``I have canvassed this subject very fully with Mr. Swett of Illinois who first suggested it to me &amp; who will seek an opportunity to converse with you upon it. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>John G. Nicolay recorded Raymond's interview with Lincoln on August 25: ``The President and the stronger half of the Cabinet, Seward, Stanton, and Fessenden, held a consultation with him [Raymond] and showed him that they had thoroughly considered and discussed the proposition of his letter of the 22d; and on giving him their reasons he very readily concurred with them in the opinion that to follow his plan of sending a commission to Richmond would be worse than losing the Presidential contest---it would be ignominiously surrendering it in advance. Nevertheless the visit of himself and committee here did great good. They found the President and Cabinet much better informed than themselves, and went home encouraged and cheered.''

<p>``The President sent me a bundle of papers, embracing a petition drawn up with great ability and skill, signed by most of the Massachusetts delegation in Congress and a large number of the prominent merchants in Boston, asking special favors in behalf of Smith Brothers, who are under arrest for fraudulent deliveries under contract, requesting that the trial may be held in Boston and that it may be . . . transferred to the civil tribunals. . . . The whole scheme had been well studied and laboriously got up, and a special delegation have come on to press the subject upon the President.</p>
<p>``He urged me to relieve him from the annoying and tremendous pressure that had been brought to bear upon him in this case. . . . I went briefly over the main points; told him the whole subject ought to be referred to and left with the navy Department in this stage of the proceedings, that I desired to relieve himself of all care and trouble by throwing the whole responsibility and odium, if there was odium, on the Navy Department, that we could not pursue a different course in this case from the others. . . . He then asked why not let the trial take place in Boston and thus concede something. I told him this might be done, but it seemed to me inexpedient; but he was so solicitous---political and party considerations had been artfully introduced, against which little could be urged, when Solicitor [William] Whiting and others averred that three Congressional districts would be sacrificed if I persisted---that the point was waived and the President greatly relieved. The President evinced shrewdness in influencing, or directing me, but was sadly imposed upon by the cunning Bostonians. . . .''</p>

<p>Mr. Louis A. Welton came from the rebel lines into ours with a written contract to furnish large supplies to the rebels, was arrested with the contract in his possession, and has been sentenced to imprisonment for it. He, and his friends complain of this, on no substantial evidence whatever, but simply because his word, only given after his arrest, that he only took the contract as a means of escaping from the rebel lines, was not accepted as a full defence. He perceives that if this had been true he would have destroyed the contract so soon as it had served his purpose in getting him across the lines; but not having done this, and being caught with the paper on him, he tells this other absurd story that he kept the<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;527</span>
paper in the belief that our government would join him in taking the profit of fulfiling the contract.</p>
<p>This is my understanding of the case; and I can not conceive of a case of a man found in possession of a contract to furnish rebel supplies, who can not escape, if this be held a sufficient ground of escape. It is simply for the accused to escape by telling a very absurd and improbable story.

<p>SOLDIERS OF THE 148TH OHIO:---I am most happy to meet you on this occasion. I understand that it has been your honorable privilege to stand, for a brief period, in the defense of your country, and that now you are on your way to your homes. I congratulate you, and those who are waiting to bid you welcome home from the war; and permit me, in the name of the people, to thank you for the part you have taken in this struggle for the life of the nation. You are soldiers of the Republic, everywhere honored and respected. Whenever I appear before a body of soldiers, I feel tempted to talk to them of the nature of the struggle in which we are engaged. I look upon it as an attempt on the one hand to overwhelm and destroy the national existence, while, on our part, we are striving to maintain the government and institutions of our fathers, to enjoy them ourselves, and transmit them to our children and our children's children forever.</p>
<p>To do this the constitutional administration of our government must be sustained, and I beg of you not to allow your minds or your hearts to be diverted from the support of all necessary measures for that purpose, by any miserable picayune arguments addressed to your pockets, or inflammatory appeals made to your passions or your prejudices.</p>
<p>It is vain and foolish to arraign this man or that for the part he has taken, or has not taken, and to hold the government responsible for his acts. In no administration can there be perfect equality of action and uniform satisfaction rendered by all. But this government must be preserved in spite of the acts of any man or set of men. It is worthy your every effort. Nowhere in the world is presented a government of so much liberty and equality. To the humblest and poorest amongst us are held out the highest privileges and positions. The present moment finds me at the White House, yet there is as good a chance for your children as there was for my father's.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;529</span>Again I admonish you not to be turned from your stern purpose of defending your beloved country and its free institutions by any arguments urged by ambitious and designing men, but stand fast to the Union and the old flag. Soldiers, I bid you God-speed to your homes.</p>

<p>It is represented to me that there are at Rock Island, Ills. as rebel prisoners of war, many persons of Northern and foreign birth, who are unwilling to be exchanged and sent South, but who wish to take the oath of allegiance and enter the military service of the Union. Col. Huidekoper on behalf of the people of some parts of Pennsylvania wishes to pay the bounties the government would have to pay to proper persons of this class, have them enter the service of the United States, and be credited to the localities furnishing the bounty money. He will, therefore proceed to Rock Island, ascertain the names of such persons (not including any who have attractions Southward) and telegraph them to the Provost Marshal General here, whereupon directions will be given to discharge the persons named upon their taking the oath of allegiance; and then upon the official evidence being furnished that they shall have been duly received and mustered into the service of the United States, their number will be credited as may be directed by Col.

My esteemed friend. Washington, September 4. 1864.</div>
<p>I have not forgotten---probably never shall forget---the very impressive occasion when yourself and friends visited me on a Sabbath forenoon two years ago. Nor has your kind letter, written nearly a year later, ever been forgotten. In all, it has been your purpose to strengthen my reliance on God. I am much indebted to the good christian people of the country for their constant prayers and consolations; and to no one of them, more than to yourself. The purposes of the Almighty are perfect, and must prevail, though we erring mortals may fail to accurately perceive them in advance. We hoped for a happy termination of this terrible war long before this; but God knows best, and has ruled otherwise. We shall yet acknowledge His wisdom and our own error therein. Meanwhile we must work earnestly in the best light He gives us, trusting that so working still conduces to the great ends He ordains. Surely He intends some great good to follow this mighty convulsion, which no mortal could make, and no mortal could stay.</p>
<p>Your people---the Friends---have had, and are having, a very great trial. On principle, and faith, opposed to both war and oppression, they can only practically oppose oppression by war. In this hard dilemma, some have chosen one horn and some the other. For those appealing to me on conscientious grounds, I have done, and shall do, the best I could and can, in my own conscience, under my oath to the law. That you believe this I doubt not; and believing it, I shall still receive, for our country and myself, your earnest prayers to our Father in Heaven. Your sincere friend</p>

I would . . . remark, that the very kind consideration for the religious scruples of the society of Friends, which has been so invariably and generously manifested by the Government, and especially by our honoured <span class="rend-i">Executive</span>, has been fully and gratefully appreciated.

According to the catalog description, Lincoln's endorsement is written on the back of AGO <span class="rend-i">Circular No. 61</span>, September 2, 1864. No reply from Grant is mentioned, and no date is given for Lincoln's endorsement. The date supplied above is derived from a letter written to Lincoln by Chaplain Benjamin S. Fry, Sixty-third Ohio Volunteers, Lookout Mountain, Officers Hospital, September 7, 1864: ``Before I was sent to the rear on account of disability, I hear many officers complaining bitterly of late orders of the War Department, for which however generally you were cursed. I refer to those orders which compel officers to serve three years from their last muster; which in some instances will require five years service. . . . Men are anticipating a forced stay in the army beyond the period for which they enlisted or were mustered. . . . There is the deepest feeling on this subject and a growing ill-will against the Administration. . . . Many of the men are deeply in earnest and they are exerting an influence against your re-election that will command many votes.'' (DLC-RTL). The first two paragraphs in <span class="rend-i">Circular No. 61</span> stated that officers who received new commissions would be held for three years from the date of their new commission. AGO <span class="rend-i">Circular No. 75</span>, September 22, 1864, revoked <span class="rend-i">Circular No. 61</span> and substituted new regulations as follows:</p>
<p>``1. Hereafter when a commissioned officer of a three-years' volunteer organization receives a new commission . . . he may at his option be mustered into the U.S. service for three years or the unexpired term of the organization of which he may at the time be a member; provided that no officer . . . so receiving a commission shall be mustered in for a less period than three years if at the date he presents himself for muster under it he has less than six months to serve.</p>
<p>``2. All regimental officers of volunteers now in the service of the United States who have been in the said service three years, and all who shall hereafter have served three years, may, if they so desire, be mustered out and honorably discharged the service on satisfactory proof being furnished . . . that they have so served. . . .''

Bridges (DNA, U.S. Army Court Martial cases, RG 130, White House Office). On August 18, 1864, Colonel George W.

<p>Nicolay answered on the same day: ``If Governor Johnson thinks execution of sentence in case of Wm. R. Bridges should be further suspended, and will request it, the President will order it.'' (DNA WR RG 107, Presidential Telegrams, I, 135).</p>
<p>On August 30 Colonel George W.

In the trial before the Court Martial his witnesses did not come in time . . . their testimony was not admitted If it had he would have been acquitted The Judge Advocate . . . who reviewed the case will recommend indefinite postponement of his case from what he has heard since the trial. . . . If it can be postponed until further orders I feel sure he can establish his innocence I hope you will find it consistent to do so in this a peculiar case I am taking the testimony. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>On September 6 Governor Johnson telegraphed: ``In regard to the execution of Thos R Bridges on friday next you state in your dispatch to Col Geo Bridges that if I desire the suspension it would be granted I would suggest that it be extended twenty days persons who are reliable inform me that facts &amp; circumstances are being developed which will go a great way in mitigation of the offence if not to entirely exonerate him answer.''

The term of service of their enlistment was short, but distinguished by memorable events. In the Valley of the Shenandoah, on the Peninsula, in the operations on the James River, around Petersburg and Richmond, in the battle of Monocacy and in the entrenchments of Washington, and in other important service, the National Guard of Ohio performed with alacrity the duty of patriotic volunteers, for which they are entitled to and are hereby tendered, through the Governor of their State, the National thanks.</p>

<div class="opener">[c. September 12, 1864]</div>
<p>The President has known me intimately for nearly twenty years, and has often heard me sing little ditties. The battle of Antietam was fought on the 17th. day of September 1862. On the first day of October, just two weeks after the battle, the President, with some others including myself, started from Washington to visit the Army, reaching Harper's Ferry at noon of that day. In a short while Gen. McClellan came from his Head Quarters near the battle ground, joined the President, and with him, reviewed, the troops at Bolivar Heights that afternoon; and, at night, returned to his Head Quarters, leaving the President at Harper's Ferry. On the morning of the second, the President, with Gen. Sumner, reviewed<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;549</span>
the troops respectively at Loudon Heights and Maryland Heights, and at about noon, started to Gen. McClellan's Head Quarters, reaching there only in time to see very little before night. On the morning of the third all started on a review of the three corps, and the Cavalry, in the vicinity of the Antietam battle ground. After getting through with Gen. Burnsides Corps, at the suggestion of Gen. McClellan, he and the President left their horses to be led, and went into an ambulance or ambulances to go to Gen. Fitz John Porter's Corps, which was two or three miles distant. I am not sure whether the President and Gen. Mc. were in the same ambulance, or in different ones; but myself and some others were in the same with the President. On the way, and on no part of the battleground, and on what suggestion I do not remember, the President asked me to sing the little sad song, that follows, which he had often heard me sing, and had always seemed to like very much. I sang them. After it was over, some one of the party, (I do not think it was the President) asked me to sing something else; and I sang two or three little comic things of which Picayune Butler was one. Porter's Corps was reached and reviewed; then the battle ground was passed over, and the most noted parts examined; then, in succession the Cavalry, and Franklin's Corps were reviewed, and the President and party returned to Gen. McClellan's Head Quarters at the end of a very hard, hot, and dusty day's work. Next day, the 4th. the President and Gen. Mc. visited such of the wounded as still remained in the vicinity, including the now lamented Gen. Richardson; then proceed[ed] to and examined the South-Mountain battle ground, at which point they parted, Gen. McClellan returning to his Camp, and the President returning to Washington, seeing, on the way, Gen Hartsuff, who lay wounded at Frederick Town. This is the whole story of the singing and it's surroundings. Neither Gen. McClellan or any one else made any objection to the singing; the place was not on the battle field, the time was sixteen days after the battle, no dead body was seen during the whole time the president was absent from Washington, nor even a grave that had not been rained on since it was made.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; AD, CSmH. The manuscript is in Lincoln's autograph except for Lamon's signature. Hertz (II, 944) dates the memorandum September 10, 1864, and Angle (p. 357), ``---1864.'' According to Lamon (<span class="rend-i">Recollections of Lincoln</span>, pp. 144-49), Lincoln wrote this memorandum ``about the 12th of September, 1864,'' to be published, if necessary, in refutation of a story widely disseminated by the Copperhead press. The memorandum was not, however, given to the newspapers. Lamon gives the following letter as the occasion for Lincoln's preparation of the memorandum:<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;550</span></p>
<p>``Ward H. Lamon: Philadelphia, Sept. 10, 1864.</p>
<p>``Dear Sir,---Enclosed is an extract from the New York `World' of Sept. 9, 1864:---</p>
<p>`` `ONE of MR. LINCOLN'S JOKES.---The second verse of our campaign song published on this page was probably suggested by an incident which occurred on the battle-field of Antietam a few days after the fight. While the President was driving over the field in an ambulance, accompanied by Marshal Lamon, General McClellan, and another officer, heavy details of men were engaged in the task of burying the dead. The ambulance had just reached the neighborhood of the old stone bridge, where the dead were piled highest, when Mr. Lincoln, suddenly slapping Marshal Lamon on the knee, exclaimed: ``Come, Lamon, give us that song about Picayune Butler; McClellan has never heard it,'' ``Not now, if you please,'' said General McClellan, with a shudder; ``I would prefer to hear it some other place and time.'' '</p>
<p>``This story has been repeated in the New York `World' almost daily for the last three months. Until now it would have been useless to demand its authority. By this article it limits the inquiry to three persons as its authority,---Marshal Lamon, another officer, and General McClellan. That it is a damaging story, if believed, cannot be disputed. That it is believed by some, or that they pretend to believe it, is evident by the accompanying verse from the doggerel, in which allusion is made to it:---</p>
<p>`<span class="rend-i">Abe may crack his jolly jokes</span></p>
<p><span class="rend-i">O'er bloody fields of stricken battle</span>,
<span class="rend-i">While yet the ebbing life-tide smokes</span> <span class="rend-i">From men that die like butchered cattle</span>;
<span class="rend-i">He, ere yet the guns grow cold</span>,
<span class="rend-i">To pimps and pets may crack his stories,' etc</span>.</p>
<p>``I wish to ask you, sir, in behalf of others as well as myself, whether any such occurrence took place; or if it did not take place, please to state who that `other officer' was, if there was any such, in the ambulance in which the President `was driving over the field [of Antietam] whilst details of men were engaged in the task of burying the dead.' You will confer a great favor by an immediate reply.</p>
