<div class="textindentlevelx">
<div class="opener">Isaac M. Schemerhorn Executive Mansion,<br>
My dear Sir. Washington, Sept. 12. 1864.</div>
<p>Yours inviting me to attend a Union Mass Meeting at Buffalo is received. Much is being said about peace; and no man desires peace more ardently than I. Still I am yet unprepared to give up the Union for a peace which, so achieved, could not be of much duration. The preservation of our Union was <span class="rend-i">not</span> the sole avowed object for which the war was commenced. It was commenced for precisely the reverse object---<span class="rend-i">to destroy our Union</span>. The insurgents commenced it by firing upon the Star of the West, and on Fort Sumpter, and by other similar acts. It is true, however, that the administration accepted the war thus commenced, for the sole avowed object of preserving our Union; and it is not true that it has since been, or will be, prossecuted by this administration, for any other object. In declaring this, I only declare what I can know, and do know to be true, and what no other man can know to be false.</p>
<p>In taking the various steps which have led to my present position in relation to the war, the public interest and my private interest, have been perfectly paralel, because in no other way could I serve myself so well, as by truly serving the Union. The whole field has been open to me, where to choose. No place-hunting necessity has been upon me urging me to seek a position of antagonism to some other man, irrespective of whether such position might be favorable or unfavorable to the Union.</p>
<p>Of course I may err in judgment, but my present position in reference to the rebellion is the result of my best judgment, and according to that best judgment, it is the only position upon which any Executive can or could save the Union. Any substantial departure from it insures the success of the rebellion. An armistice---a cessation of hostilities---is the end of the struggle, and the insurgents<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;2</span>
would be in peaceable possession of all that has been struggled for. Any different policy in regard to the colored man, deprives us of his help, and this is more than we can bear. We can not spare the hundred and forty or fifty thousand now serving us as soldiers, seamen, and laborers. This is not a question of sentiment or taste, but one of physical force which may be measured and estimated as horse-power and Steam-power are measured and estimated. Keep it and you can save the Union. Throw it away, and the Union goes with it. Nor is it possible for any Administration to retain the service of these people with the express or implied understanding that upon the first convenient occasion, they are to be re-inslaved. It <span class="rend-i">can</span> not be; and it <span class="rend-i">ought</span> not to be.</p>

<p>My dear Sir: Your letter, mentioned in your two telegrams, has not reached me; so that I am without knowledge of its particulars. I beg you to pardon me for having concluded that it is not best for me now to write a general letter to a political meeting. First, I believe it is not customary for one holding the office, and being a candidate for re-election, to do so; and secondly, a public letter must be written with some care, and at some expense of time, so that having begun with your meeting, I could not well refuse others, and yet could not get through with all having equal claims. Please tender to those you represent my sincere thanks for the invitation, and my appeal to their indulgence for having declined their request. Yours very truly. A. LINCOLN.</p>

We had heard the right sort of speeches from Vermont and Maine lately, and previously from Mobile and Atlanta, and he was much in favor of hearing more of the same sort from the South.</p>

<p>The State election of Indiana occurs on the 11th. of October, and the loss of it to the friends of the Government would go far towards losing the whole Union cause. The bad effect upon the November election, and especially the giving the State Government to those who will oppose the war in every possible way, are too much to risk, if it can possibly be avoided. The draft proceeds, notwithstanding its strong tendency to lose us the State. Indiana is the only important State, voting in October, whose soldiers cannot vote in the field. Any thing you can safely do to let her soldiers, or any part of them, go home and vote at the State election, will be greatly in point. They need not remain for the Presidential election, but may return to you at once. This is, in no sense, an order, but is merely intended to impress you with the importance, to the army itself, of your doing all you safely can, yourself being the judge of what you can safely do.

On September 19 Sheridan had telegraphed Grant: ``I have the honor to report that I attacked the forces of Genl Early over the Berryville Pike at the crossing of Opequan Creek, and after a most stubborn and sanguinary engagement . . . completely defeated him . . . driving him through Winchester, capturing about twenty five hundred (2500) prisoners---five (5) of artillery, nine (9) Army flags and most of their wounded. . . .''

The date September 20, 1864, is given on the official copy, but the <span class="rend-i">Official Records</span> print it without date. On September 10, S. Newton Pettis had written Lincoln from Rock Island, Illinois, where he had gone with Lincoln's order of September 1. Colonel Huidekoper not being able to be there ``for a day or two,'' Pettis had shown the order to the commandant:</p>
<p>``The first remark he made was, that he had often wondered why the Government had not allowed recruiting for the army before, as well as for the Navy. The second remark was that there would be a difficulty . . . for this reason. When the first body of men were recruited for the Navy, about a hundred who had <span class="rend-i">volunteered and taken the oath of allegiance</span> were rejected by the surgeon as unfit, and were at once discharged. The next party recruited for the Navy in the same way, about the same number rejected &amp; the order for their discharge was revoked, consequently they were thrown back into prison and have been abused by the rabid and malicious secesh so that many are afraid to come out for . . . volunteering, lest they are rejected. . . .</p>
<p>``I read your order over again . . . and gave it as my opinion that you never intended to have a man <span class="rend-i">remanded</span> after he had volunteered and taken the oath even if he was rejected. . . . I also told him to say to those who feared that result if they took the oath and volunteered &amp; were rejected by the Surgeon that they would be discharged. I have no doubt the letter &amp; spirit of your order warranted such a request. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>On September 22, Captain Henry R. Rathbone of the Twelfth U.S. Infantry was ordered to Rock Island to make a ``special inspection, under instructions to be given him by the Provost Marshal General'' of the prisoners to be enlisted (AGO <span class="rend-i">Special Orders No. 315</span>), and on the same date Lincoln wrote Grant in explanation of his action (<span class="rend-i">vide infra</span>).</p>

<p>``From many years intercourse in Louisiana I have a large acquaintance &amp; this has been renewed the last nine months of being in N O.

<p>``Genl Baily has just handed me your note of Sept. 24 [<span class="rend-i">sic</span>] in relation to the destitute union people in the neighborhood of Alexandria La. I would long since have sent supplies to them . . . if I could have had even a doubtful assurance that they would have reached their destination, or that they could have been applied to the benefit of those for whom they were intended, but my own convictions have been confirmed by the assurances of loyal persons living within the rebel lines, that any attempt of this kind would not be to their benefit and would only compromize them with the rebel authorities, and that any general system of supplying the inhabitants beyond the lines would have no other result than to prolong the war and their own suffering.</p>
<p>``The policy of the rebels in this respect is unrelenting. . . . I am satisfied that until we can break the armed power of the rebels we can do nothing that will not aid our enemies and injure our friends.</p>

<p>Montgomery Blair's unpopularity with the radical Republicans, Frémont's supporters in particular, is borne out by numerous letters in the Lincoln Papers which recommend his removal. Undoubtedly Lincoln's action was prompted by his desire to consolidate Republican support in the forthcoming election. A letter of Francis P. Blair, Jr., to his father, September 30, 1864, reads: ``I received<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;19</span>
yours and my sisters letter yesterday giving an account of late transactions in Washington. I feel in regard to the matter precisely as you do. Indeed before I received your letter my instincts told me that my brother had acted his part for the good of the country and for the re-election of Mr. Lincoln in which the safety of the country is involved I believe that a failure to re-elect Mr. Lincoln would be the greatest disaster that could befall the country and the sacrifice made by the Judge to avert this is so incomparably small that I felt it would not cost him a penny to make. Indeed the only sacrifice involved in it appears to be the triumph which it gives to our enemies &amp; the enemies of the Presidents. It is somewhat mortifying to reflect that this triumph has been given to those who are equally the enemies of the President &amp; `the Blairs' but at the same time the Judge leaves the cabinet with an untarnished name and the reputation of having administered the Dept with the greatest ability &amp; success and that as far as worldly considerations go, it is far better for him to go out than to remain in the cabinet. This is rather a contrast to the position of Chase, Fremont &amp; all the rest of the enemies &amp; persecutors of the `Blairs'. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>

Major General Rosecrans, Washington, Sep. 26, 1864</div>
<p>One can not always safely disregard a report, even which one may not believe. I have a report that you incline to deny the soldiers the right of attending the election in Missouri, on the assumed ground that they will get drunk and make disturbance. Last year I sent Gen. Schofield a letter of instruction, dated October 1st, 1863, which I suppose you will find on the files of the Department, and which contains, among other things, the following:</p>
<p>``At elections see that those and only those, are allowed to vote, who are entitled to do so by the laws of Missouri, including as of those laws, the restrictions laid by the Missouri Convention upon those who may have participated in the rebellion.''</p>
<p>This I thought right then, and think right now; and I may add I do not remember that either party complained after the election, of Gen. Schofield's action under it. Wherever the law allows soldiers to vote, their officers must also allow it. Please write me on this subject. Yours truly, A. LINCOLN.</p>

<p>``In less than an hour the President returned with Seward. We went briefly over the question. . . . After discussing the subject, went, by request of the President, with him to the War Department. General Hitchcock and General Halleck came in soon. Stanton was ill-mannered, as usual, where things did not please him. . . . The President said that the correspondence was a past transaction,---that we need not disturb that matter; the Navy arrangement must go forward, and the Navy have its men. He wrote and read a brief letter to General Grant proposing to turn over the prisoners we had sent to him. . . . Hitchcock . . . began a speech . . . intimating that the War Department should have exclusive control of the cartel. . . . I told him I was perfectly willing . . . if they would not obstruct the exchange but get back our men. All assented to the President's letter. Stanton and Seward preferred it should be addressed to General Butler. . . . But the President preferred addressing the General-in-Chief, and I commended his preference. We telegraphed Capt.

My dear Sir: October 10, 1864.</div>
<p>A convention of Maryland has framed a new constitution for the State; a public meeting is called for this evening, at Baltimore, to aid in securing its ratification by the people; and you ask a word from me, for the occasion. I presume the only feature of the instrument, about which there is serious controversy, is that which provides for the extinction of slavery. It needs not to be a secret, and I presume it is no secret, that I wish success to this provision. I desire it on every consideration. I wish all men to be free. I wish the material prosperity of the already free which I feel sure the extinction of slavery would bring. I wish to see, in process of disappearing, that only thing which ever could bring this nation to civil war. I attempt no argument.

<p>``Our grand Mass Meeting in favor of the `Free Constitution' will be held in Monument Square on Monday evening October 10th.</p>
<p>``In consequence of local dissensions and with a view to general harmony and cordial fraternization upon the new Constitution, the Committee have resolved to rely exclusively upon speakers from other States at this meeting.</p>
<p>``We are convinced that your presence on the occasion would insure its success both as to harmony and point of numbers and that its influence upon the vote to be taken on the Following Wednesday would be to add hundreds and perhaps thousands of votes to the free State column. We therefore most cordially and earnestly invite your attendance. If however you should feel disinclined to comply with the urgent request of the Committee . . . we are well assured that a letter from you expressive of the deep interest which we know you feel in regard to its success would be productive of the greatest good. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>On October 12 Hoffman wrote: ``Many thanks for your letter of Monday It was recd with the unbounded applause of the many thousands assembled The meeting was a great success in point of numbers Harmony &amp; enthusiasm The new constitution will be adopted The majority in this city will not fall short of ten thousand from present indications.

<p>the proceedings of a board of officers convened by <span class="rend-i">Special Orders No. 228</span>, Headquarters, Department of Washington, September 13, 1864, upon the claim of Catharine Carberry for loss and damage to her property sustained during the raid of the Confederates on Washington in July, 1864. The proceedings refer to the communication as exhibit ``A.'' These proceedings are filed in the Forty-eighth Congress collection presumably because the Committee on the Judiciary had under consideration the bill for claims of Catharine Carberry and Richard Lay (H.R. 5407). The committee reported the bill adversely:</p>
<p>``The claimants insist that these facts make a case of the taking of private property for public use, and entitle them to payment for their losses. Similar claims have been before Congress repeatedly since the close of the war of the rebellion, and have been discussed in many reports of committees, and on the floor of both houses.</p>
<p>``The committee think the law of this subject has become settled that such claims are for losses and damage by war, and not a taking of private property for public use. The subject was most exhaustively examined in a report of the Committee on War Claims in the Forty-seventh Congress. . . . We think their conclusions are sound, but they are fatal to this bill.''

<p>I am notified that this is a compliment paid me by the loyal Marylanders, resident in this District. I infer that the adoption of the new constitution for the State, furnishes the occasion; and that, in your view, the extirpation of slavery constitutes the chief merit of the new constitution. Most heartily do I congratulate you, and Maryland, and the nation, and the world, upon the event. I regret that it did not occur two years sooner, which I am sure would have saved to the nation more money than would have met all the private loss incident to the measure. But it has come at last, and I sincerely hope it's friends may fully realize all their anticipations of good from it; and that it's opponents may, by it's effects, be agreeably and profitably, disappointed.</p>
<p>A word upon another subject.</p>
<p>Something said by the Secretary of State in his recent speech at Auburn, has been construed by some into a threat that, if I shall be beaten at the election, I will, between then and the end of my constitutional term, do what I may be able, to ruin the government.</p>
<p>Others regard the fact that the Chicago Convention adjourned, not <span class="rend-i">sine die</span>, but to meet again, if called to do so by a particular individual, as the intimation of a purpose that if their nominee shall be elected, he will at once seize control of the government. I hope the good people will permit themselves to suffer no uneasiness on either point. I am struggling to maintain government, not to overthrow it. I am struggling especially to prevent others from overthrowing it. I therefore say, that if I shall live, I shall remain President until the fourth of next March; and that whoever shall be constitutionally elected therefor in November, shall be duly installed as President on the fourth of March; and that in the interval I shall do my utmost that whoever is to hold the helm for the next voyage, shall start with the best possible chance to save the ship.</p>
<p>This is due to the people both on principle, and under the constitution. Their will, constitutionally expressed, is the ultimate law for all. If they should deliberately resolve to have immediate peace even at the loss of their country, and their liberty, I know not the power or the right to resist them. It is their own business, and they must do as they please with their own. I believe, however, they are<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;53</span>
still resolved to preserve their country and their liberty; and in this, in office or out of it, I am resolved to stand by them.</p>
<p>I may add that in this purpose to save the country and it's liberties, no classes of people seem so nearly unanamous as the soldiers in the field and the seamen afloat. Do they not have the hardest of it? Who should quail while they do not?</p>
<p>God bless the soldiers and seamen, with all their brave commanders.</p>

<p>By the President of the United States of America:</p>
<p>A Proclamation.</p>
<p>It has pleased Almighty God to prolong our national life another year, defending us with his guardian care against unfriendly designs from abroad, and vouchsafing to us in His mercy many and signal victories over the enemy, who is of our own household. It has also pleased our Heavenly Father to favor as well our citizens in their homes as our soldiers in their camps and our sailors on the rivers and seas with unusual health. He has largely augmented our free population by emancipation and by immigration, while he has opened to us new sources of wealth, and has crowned the labor of our working men in every department of industry with abundant rewards. Moreover, He has been pleased to animate and inspire our minds and hearts with fortitude, courage and resolution sufficient for the great trial of civil war into which we have been brought by our adherence as a nation to the cause of Freedom and Humanity, and to afford to us reasonable hopes of an ultimate and happy deliverance from all our dangers and afflictions.</p>
<p>Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do, hereby, appoint and set apart the last Thursday in November next as a day, which I desire to be observed by all my fellow-citizens wherever they may then be as a day of Thanksgiving and Praise to Almighty God the beneficent Creator and Ruler of the Universe. And I do farther recommend to my fellow-citizens aforesaid that on that occasion they do reverently humble themselves<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;56</span>
in the dust and from thence offer up penitent and fervent prayers and supplications to the Great Disposer of events for a return of the inestimable blessings of Peace, Union and Harmony throughout the land, which it has pleased him to assign as a dwelling place for ourselves and for our posterity throughout all generations.</p>
<p>In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>
<p>[L.S.]</p>
<p>Done at the city of Washington this twentieth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty four, and, of the Independence of the United States the eighty-ninth. ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

Washington, D.C., Oct. 22, 1864.</div>
<p>Messrs. Wm. B. Campbell, Thos. A. R. Nelson, James T. P. Carter, John Williams, A. Blizzard, Henry Cooper, Bailie Peyton, John Lellyett, Em. Etheridge, John D. Perryman:</p>
<p>Gentlemen: On the 15th day of this month, as I remember, a printed paper, with a few manuscript interlineations, called a protest, with your names appended thereto, and accompanied by another printed paper purporting to be a proclamation by Andrew Johnson, Military Governor of Tennessee, and also a manuscript<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;59</span><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;60</span><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;61</span><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;62</span>
paper purporting to be extracts from the Code of Tennessee, was laid before me. The Protest, Proclamation and Extracts are respectively as follows:</p>
<p><span class="rend-i">To his Excellency Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States</span>:</p>
<p>SIR: The undersigned, loyal citizens of the United States and of the State of Tennessee, on our own behalf and on behalf of the loyal people of our State, ask leave to submit this Protest against the Proclamation of his Excellency Andrew Johnson, Military Governor, ordering an election to be held for President and Vice President, under certain regulations and restrictions therein set forth. A printed copy of said proclamation is herewith enclosed.</p>
<p>The Constitution of the United States provides that ``Each State shall appoint, <span class="rend-i">in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct</span>, a number of electors,'' &amp;c. Under this provision of the Federal Constitution, the Legislature of Tennessee, years before the present rebellion, prescribed the mode of election to be observed, which will be found to differ essentially from the mode prescribed by the Military Governor. We herewith enclose a copy of the Law of Tennessee governing the holding of said election.</p>
<p>The Military Governor expressly assumes, by virtue of authority derived from the President, to so alter and amend the election law of Tennessee, (enacted under authority of the Constitution of the United States, as above set forth,) as to make the same conform to his own edict as set forth in the proclamation aforesaid.</p>
<p>He assumes so as to modify our law as to admit persons to vote at the said election who are not entitled to vote under the law and the Constitution of Tennessee. Instance this: our Constitution and Law require that each voter shall be ``a citizen of the <span class="rend-i">county</span> wherein he may offer his vote, for six months next preceding the day of election;'' while the Governor's order only requires that he shall (with other qualifications named) be a citizen of Tennessee for six months, &amp;c. This provision would admit to vote many persons not entitled by law.</p>
<p>We will, for the sake of brevity, pass over some less important points of conflict between the proclamation and the law, but will instance in this place another. By our law it is provided that the polls shall be opened in every civil district in each county in the state; but the proclamation provides only for their being opened at one place in each county. This provision would put it out of the power of many legal voters to exercise the elective franchise.</p>
<p>We solemnly protest against these infringements of our law, conflicting as they do, with the very letter of the Federal Constitution, because they are without authority, and because they will prevent a free, fair, and true expression of the will of the loyal people of Tennessee.</p>
<p>But we protest still more emphatically against the most unusual and impracticable test oath which it is proposed to require of all citizen voters in Tennessee. A citizen qualified to vote, and whose loyalty cannot be ``disproved by other testimony,'' is to be required to swear, first, that he ``will henceforth support the Constitution of the United States, and defend it against all enemies.'' This obligation we are willing to renew daily; but this is not yet deemed a sufficient test of loyalty. He is required to make oath and subscribe to a mass of vain repetitions<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;63</span>
concerning his activity as a friend of the Union and the enemy of its enemies---concerning his desires his hopes and fears---and that he finds it in his heart to rejoice over the scenes of blood, and of wounds, of anguish and death, wherein his friends, his kindred, his loved ones are slain, or maimed, or made prisoners of war---whereby the land of his birth or adoption is made desolate, and lamentation and mourning are spread over the whole nation. While all the civilized world stands aghast in contemplation of the unequalled horrors of our tremendous strife, the citizen of Tennessee is called upon by her Military Governor, under your authority, to swear that in these things he finds occasion to <span class="rend-i">rejoice</span>! As if this were still not enough, the citizen is further required to swear to the indefinite prolongation of this war, as follows: ``That I will cordially oppose all armistices or <span class="rend-i">negotiations for peace with rebels in arms</span>, until the Constitution of the United States and all laws and proclamations made in pursuance thereof shall be established over all the people of every State and Territory embraced within the National Union;'' until (in brief) the war shall be at an end. Now, we freely avow to your Excellency, and to the world, that we earnestly desire the return of peace and good-will to our now unhappy country---that we seek neither pleasure, profit, nor honor in the perpetuation of war---that we should feel bound, as Christians, as patriots and as civilized men---that we are bound by the oaths we have taken---to countenance and encourage any negotiations which may be entered into by the proper authorities with the intent to restore peace and union under the Constitution we have sworn to support and defend. We should be traitors to our country, false to our oaths---false, indeed, to the primary clause of the oath we are now discussing, to oppose such negotiations. We cannot consent to swear at the ballot-box a war of extermination against our countrymen and kindred, or to prolong by our opposition, for a single day after it can be brought to an honorable and lawful conclusion, a contest the most sanguinary and ruinous that has scourged mankind.</p>
<p>You will not have forgotten, that in the month of July last, you issued the following proclamation:</p>
<p>``Executive Mansion,</p>
<p>``To whom it may concern: Washington, July 8 [18], 1864.</p>
<p>``Any proposition which embraces the restoration of peace, the integrity of the whole Union, and the abandonment of slavery, and which comes by and with an authority that can control the armies now at war against the United States, will be received and considered by the Executive Government of the United States, and will be met by liberal terms on other substantial and collateral points; and the bearer or bearers thereof shall have safe conduct both ways.</p>
<p>``ABRAHAM LINCOLN.''</p>
<p>This is certainly a proposition to treat with rebels in arms---with their chiefs. Are we now to understand by this proclamation of one acting under your authority, and himself a candidate with you for the second office, that even the above proposition is withdrawn---that you will henceforth have no negotiations upon any terms, but unrelenting war to the bitter end? Or, are we to understand, that while you hold this proposition open, or yourself free to act as your judgment may dictate,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;64</span>
we, the citizens of Tennessee, shall <span class="rend-i">swear</span> to OPPOSE your negotiations?</p>
<p>In the next breath, the voter who has been thus <span class="rend-i">qualified</span>, is required to swear that he will ``heartily aid and assist the loyal people <span class="rend-i">in whatever measures may be adopted</span> for the attainment of these ends.'' Adopted by whom? The oath does not say. We cannot tell what measures may be adopted. We cannot comment upon the absurdity of the obligation here imposed, without danger of departing from that respectful propriety of language which we desire to preserve in addressing the Chief Magistrate of the American people. But this is a clause of an oath which the candidate for the Vice Presidency requires at the lips of the loyal and qualified voters of Tennessee, before these citizens shall be allowed to vote for or against you and himself at the coming election!</p>
<p>For these reasons, and others, which, for the sake of brevity, we omit, we solemnly protest against the interference of the Military Governor with the freedom of the elective franchise in Tennessee. We deny his authority and yours, to alter, amend, or annul any law of Tennessee. We demand that Tennessee be allowed to appoint her Electors as expressly provided by the Federal Constitution, which you have sworn to support, protect, and defend, in the manner which the Legislature thereof has prescribed. And to that end we respectfully demand of you, as the principal under whose authority this order has been issued, that the same shall be revoked. We ask that all military interference shall be withdrawn so far as to allow the loyal men of Tennessee a full and free election. By the loyal men of Tennessee we mean those who have not participated in the rebellion, or given it aid and comfort; or who may have complied with such terms of amnesty as have been offered them under your authority.</p>
<p>On the 8th day of December, 1863, you, as President, issued a Proclamation, declaring that ``a full pardon is hereby granted, with restoration of all rights of property,'' &amp;c., to each of our citizens having participated, directly or by implication, in the existing rebellion, (with certain exceptions,) ``upon the condition that every such person shall take and subscribe an oath, and thenceforward keep and maintain said oath inviolate.'' And it is further provided in the Proclamation aforesaid, that in the contingency of the reorganization of a State Government in Tennessee, or certain other States named, the persons having taken the oath referred to, being otherwise qualified by the election law of the State, shall be entitled to vote. The undersigned would state, that many of our citizens have complied in good faith with the terms of amnesty proposed in your Proclamation aforesaid; and are, therefore, by reason of the full pardon granted them, fully entitled to vote and exercise all other rights belonging to loyal citizens, without let or hindrance; and we respectfully appeal to you, as President of the United States, to make good your promise of pardon to these citizens, by the removal of all other and further hindrance to their exercise of the elective franchise.</p>
<p>But if it be claimed upon the plea of military necessity, that guards and restrictions shall be thrown around the ballot-box in Tennessee, we still ask the withdrawal of the Proclamation of the Military Governor, because the conditions thereby imposed upon the loyal men of Tennessee as a qualification for voting, are irrelevant, unreasonable,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;65</span>
and not in any sense a test of loyalty. But they pledge the citizen to oppose the lawful authorities in the discharge of their duty. The oath required is only calculated to keep legal and rightful voters from the polls. We suggest that no oath be required but such as is prescribed by law. Our people will not hesitate, however, to take the usual oath of loyalty---for example, in the language of the primary clause of the oath in question: ``That I will henceforth support the Constitution of the United States, and defend it against the assaults of its enemies.'' Denying your right to make any departure from the law in the case, we shall, however, feel no hardship in this.</p>
<p>The convention to which Governor Johnson refers was a mere partisan meeting, having no authority, and not representing the loyal men of Tennessee, in any sense.</p>
<p>The names of the signers of this protest have been placed before the people of Tennessee as candidates for Electors, who, if chosen, are expected to cast the electoral vote of Tennessee for George B. McClellan for President, and George H. Pendleton for Vice President. By virtue of such position, it becomes our province especially to appear before you in the attitude we do. We are aware that grave questions may arise, in any event, with regard to the regularity of the vote in Tennessee, in consequence of the partially disorganized condition of the State. The friends of your re-election, however, announced an electoral ticket; and the public became aware that preparations were being made for the holding of the election, leaving that matter no longer a question. Some time thereafter, our electoral ticket was placed before the public, and within a few days followed the proclamation complained of. We, for ourselves and those we represent, are willing to leave all questions involving the right of Tennessee to participate in the election to the decision of competent authority.</p>

<p>State of Tennessee,</p>
<p>Nashville, Tenn. Sept 30th, 1864. Executive Department,</p>
<p>Whereas, a respectable portion of the loyal people of Tennessee, representing a large number of the counties of the State, and supposed to<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;66</span>
reflect the will of the Union men in their respective counties, recently held a convention in the city of Nashville, in which, among other things touching the re-organization of the State, they with great unanimity adopted the following resolutions:</p>
<p>2. <span class="rend-i">Resolved</span>, That the people of Tennessee who are now and have been attached to the National Union, do hold an election for President and Vice President in the ensuing election in November.</p>
<p>3. That the electors shall be the following and no others; the same being free white men, twenty-one years of age, citizens of the United States, and for six months previous to the election, citizens of the State of Tennessee---</p>
<p>1st. All who have voluntarily borne arms in the service of the United States during the present war, and who are either in the service or have been honorably discharged.</p>
<p>2d. All the known active friends of the Government of the United States in each county.</p>
<p>4. <span class="rend-i">Resolved</span>, That the citizen electors designated in the foregoing resolutions shall, at least fifteen days before the election, register their names with an agent to be appointed for that purpose, and no citizen not thus registered shall be allowed to vote. Such registration shall be open to the public for inspection, and to be executed according to such regulations as may hereafter be prescribed: Provided that the officers of the election, in the discharge of their duty, may reject any party so registered on proof of disloyalty.</p>
<p>5. <span class="rend-i">Resolved</span>, That, as means for ascertaining the qualification of the voters, the registers and officers holding the election may examine the parties on oath touching any matter of fact. And each voter, before depositing his vote, shall be required to take and subscribe the following oath, viz:</p>
<p>I solemnly swear that I will henceforth support the Constitution of the United States, and defend it against the assaults of all enemies; that I am an active friend of the Government of the United States, and the enemy of the so-called Confederate States; that I ardently desire the suppression of the present rebellion against the Government of the United States; that I sincerely rejoice in the triumph of the armies and navies of the United States, and in the defeat and overthrow of the armies, navies, and of all armed combinations in the interest of the socalled Confederate States; that I will cordially oppose all armistices or negotiations for peace with rebels in arms, until the Constituion of the United States and all laws and proclamations made in pursuance thereof, shall be established over all the people of every State and Territory embraced within the National Union, and that I will heartily aid and assist the loyal people in whatever measures may be adopted for the attainment of these ends; and further, that I take this oath freely and voluntarily, and without mental reservation. So help me God.</p>
<p>Said oath being <span class="rend-i">prima facie</span> evidence, subject to be disapproved by other testimony.</p>
<p>6. <span class="rend-i">Resolved</span>, That the polls be opened at the county seat, or some other suitable place in each county, and the ballot-box be so guarded and protected as to secure to electors a free, fair, and impartial election, and that polls also be opened for the convenience of the soldiers, at such places as may be accessible to them.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;67</span>And whereas, it further appears from the proceedings of said Convention, ``That the Military Governor of the State of Tennessee is requested to execute the foregoing resolutions in such manner as he may think best subserves the interests of the Government.''</p>
<p>And whereas I, Andrew Johnson, Military Governor of the State of Tennessee, being anxious to co-operate with the loyal people of the State, and to encourage them in all laudable efforts to restore the State to law and order again, and to secure the ballot-box against the contamination of treason by every reasonable restraint that can be thrown around it, I do therefore order and direct that an election for President and Vice President of the United States of America be opened and held at the county seat, or other suitable place in every county in the State of Tennessee, upon the first Tuesday after the first Monday in the month of November next, at which all citizens and soldiers, being free white men, twenty-one years of age, citizens of the United States, and for six months prior to the election citizens of the State of Tennessee, who have qualified themselves by registration, and who take the oath prescribed in the foregoing resolutions, shall be entitled to vote, unless said oath shall be disproved by other testimony, for the candidates for President and Vice President of the United States.</p>
<p>And to the end that the foregoing resolutions, which are made part of this proclamation, may be faithfully executed, and the local citizens of the State, and none others, be permitted to exercise the right of suffrage I do hereby appoint the several gentlemen whose names are affixed to this proclamation, to aid in said election, and superintend the registration of the loyal voters in their respective counties, as provided by the fourth resolution above quoted.</p>
<p>But as the day of election is near at hand, and there may be a difficulty in completing the registration within the time limited, it is not intended that the registration be an indispensable prerequisite to the qualification of the voter; and in such cases, where it is impracticable, and where the voter is of known and established loyalty, he shall be entitled to vote, notwithstanding he may not have registered his name as required by the foregoing resolution.</p>
<p>The election shall be opened, conducted, returns made, &amp;c., in all respects as provided by the 4th chapter of the ``Code of Tennessee,'' except so far as the same is modified by this proclamation.</p>
<p>But in cases where the County Court fail or neglect to appoint inspectors or judges of election, and there is no sheriff or other civil officer in the county qualified by law to open and hold said election, the registrating agents, hereto appended, may act in his stead, and in all respects discharge the duties imposed in such cases upon sheriffs.</p>
<p>In like manner it is declared the duty of the military officers commanding Tennessee regiments, battalions, or detached squads, and surgeons in charge of the hospitals of Tennessee soldiers, to open and hold elections on the day aforesaid, under the same rules and regulations hereinbefore prescribed, and at such suitable places as will be convenient to the soldiers, who are hereby declared entitled to vote without oath or registration.</p>
<p>In testimony whereof, I, Andrew Johnson, Military Governor of the State of Tennessee, do hereunto set my hand, and have caused the Great</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;68</span>Seal of the State to be affixed at this Department, on the 30th day of September, A.D. 1864.</p>

<p><span class="rend-i">Qualification of Voters for Members of the General Assembly Referred to in Sec. 915 Above</span>.</p>
<p>``Every free white man of the age of twenty-one years, being a citizen of the United States, and a citizen of the county where he may offer his vote, six months next preceding the day of election, shall be entitled to vote for members of the General Assembly.''---<span class="rend-i">Code, Sec. 833, and Const. of Tenn., Art. 4, Sec. 1</span>.</p>

<p>``The places of holding elections shall be in each civil district, at some convenient locality, to be designated by the county court at least six months before the election, and entered on record.''---<span class="rend-i">Code 837</span>.</p>
<p>EXTRACTS FROM CODE.---ART. VI.</p>
<p><span class="rend-i">Officers of Popular Elections, Referred to in Sec. 917 Above</span>.</p>

<p>841. The county court, at the session next preceding the day of election, shall appoint three inspectors or judges for each voting place, to superintend the election.</p>
<p>842. If the county court fail to make the appointment, or any person appointed refuse to serve, the sheriff, with the advice of three justices, or, if none be present, three respectable freeholders, shall, before the beginning of the election, appoint said inspectors or judges.</p>
<p>843. If the sheriff, or other officer whose duty it is to attend at a particular place of voting under the foregoing provisions, fail to attend, any justice of the peace present, or, if no justice of the peace be present, any three freeholders may perform the duties prescribed by the preceding sections, or in case of necessity may act as officers or inspectors.</p>
<p>At the time these papers were presented as before stated, I had never seen either of them, nor heard of the subject to which they relate, except in a general way, only one day previously. Up to the present moment nothing whatever upon the subject has passed between Governor Johnson or anyone else connected with the proclamation and myself. Since receiving the papers as stated, I have given the subject such brief consideration as I have been able to do in the midst of so many pressing public duties. My conclusion is that I can have nothing to do with the matter, either to sustain the plan as the Convention and Governor Johnson have initiated it, or to revoke or modify it as you demand. By the Constitution and<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;72</span>
laws the President is charged with no duty in the conduct of a presidential election in any State; nor do I, in this case, perceive any military reason for his interference in the matter. The movement set on foot by the Convention and Governor Johnson does not, as seems to be assumed by you, emanate from the National Executive. In no proper sense can it be considered other than as an independent movement of at least a portion of the loyal people of Tennessee. I do not perceive in the plan any menace of violence or coercion towards any one. Governor Johnson, like any other loyal citizen of Tennessee, has the right to favor any political plan he chooses, and, as Military Governor, it is his duty to keep the peace among and for the loyal people of the State. I cannot discern that by this plan he purposes any more. But you object to the plan. Leaving it alone will be your perfect security against it. It is not proposed to force you into it. Do as you please on your own account peacefully and loyally, and Governor Johnson will not molest you; but will protect you against violence so far as in his power.</p>
<p>I presume that the conducting of a Presidential election in Tennessee in strict accordance with the old code of the State is not now a possibility. It is scarcely necessary to add that if any election shall be held, and any votes shall be cast in the State of Tennessee for President and Vice President of the United States, it will belong, not to the military agents, nor yet to the Executive Department, but exclusively to another department of the Government, to determine whether they are entitled to be counted, in conformity with the Constitution and laws of the United States. Except it be to give protection against violence, I decline to interfere in any way with any presidential election. ABRAHAM LINCOLN.</p>

<h3>Annotation</h3>
<a name="8_58_1"></a><div class="textindentlevelx" id="8_58_1">
<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; Washington <span class="rend-i">National Republican</span>, October 22, 1864. John Lellyett's account of the presentation of the protest is given in a letter to the editor of the New York <span class="rend-i">World</span>, October 15, 1864, which appeared in the <span class="rend-i">World</span> on October 18:</p>
<p>``I called upon the President to-day and presented and read to him the subjoined protest. Having concluded, Mr. Lincoln responded:</p>
<p>`` `May I inquire how long it took you and the New-York politicians to concoct that paper?'</p>
<p>``I replied, `It was concocted in Nashville, without communication with any but Tennesseans. We communicated with citizens of Tennessee, outside of Nashville, but not with New-York politicians.'</p>
<p>`` `I will answer', said Mr. Lincoln emphatically, `that <span class="rend-i">I expect to let the friends of George B. McClellan manage their side of this contest in their own way; and I will manage my side of it in MY way</span>.'</p>
<p>`` `May we ask an answer in writing,' I suggested.</p>
<p>`` `Not now. Lay those papers down here. I will give no other answer now. I may or may not write something about this hereafter. I understand this. I know you intend to make a point of this. But go ahead, you have my answer.'</p>
<p>`` `Your answer then is that you expect to let General McClellan's friends manage their side of this contest in their own way, and you will manage your side of it in your way?'</p>
<p>`` `Yes.'</p>
<p>``I then thanked the President for his courtesy in giving us a hearing at all, and took my leave.</p>
<p>``Judge [Charles] Mason, of this city, was present at the interview, to whom I refer in regard to the correctness of this report. On stepping outside of the door of the executive mansion I immediately wrote down the President's emphatic response, and submitted it to Judge Mason and another gentleman who happened to be present, and they both pronounced it accurate.</p>
<p>``And now I have a word to say to the people of the United States, who are, or ought to be, the masters of Abraham Lincoln. The paper which I had the honor to present to the President is not the `concoction of New-York politicians,' however that might affect its merits. It is the solemn voice of a once free and proud people, protesting against their own disfranchisement by the agent of Abraham Lincoln. It is the voice of those loyal men in Tennessee who have borne the reproach of a people they still loved, supporting the President in all lawful efforts to preserve the Union. The reward of our loyalty is disfranchisement. The cup of perjury is commended to our lips, because it is known that we will not touch its contents. Judge ye between the people of Tennessee and Abraham Lincoln. It may be meet that our solemn and respectful appeal should be thrown aside with a contemptuous sneer. Look to it. If you, the people of the Northern states, shall sustain this act of tyranny, your own time will soon come. If the President of the United States may `manage his side of this contest' by setting aside the very letter of the Constitution, and altering the election laws of the state so as to disfranchise his opponents, liberty is already dead.''</p>
<p>The reply to Lincoln's communication, signed by Campbell, Peyton, and Lellyett, appeared in the <span class="rend-i">World</span> on election day, November 8:</p>
<p>``<span class="rend-i">To Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States</span>.</p>
<p>SIR: Your letter in reply to the Tennessee protest has reached us, and has, no doubt, been read by the people. The argument on this subject is nearly exhausted, but we have some additional and most important <span class="rend-i">facts</span> to submit to the people, in further elucidation of the subject. Our wonder is not excited to learn that you had not seen the proclamation of Governor Johnson, and scarcely heard of it until presented by us. It is an evil of no small magnitude, connected with your administration, that military subordinates assume despotic powers without asking the sanction of their superiors---even presuming to give law to the people by proclamation and to repeal and modify our laws at will. The idea that the President himself can make, or repeal, or modify a law of the land, state or national, constitutional or statutory, though freely practiced upon by yourself, is a doctrine of despotism in `irrepressible conflict' with the principles of public liberty. And when these things are done by subordinates, the evil becomes intolerably oppressive, and calls for the firmest and most active lawful resistance which a people deserving to be free can offer.</p>
<p>``You tell us that `the movement set on foot by the convention and Governor Johnson does not, as seems to be assumed by you, emanate from the national executive.' What we did assume is, that the plan was promulgated by proclamation of the military governor, who has no authority but that derived directly from you, and it was given the force of law by his edict. It thus became indirectly your act; and now that you decline to order the edict to be recalled or modified, it becomes your own as fully as if it had <span class="rend-i">emanated</span> from you. `In no proper sense,' you say, `can it be considered other than an independent movement of at least a portion of the loyal people of Tennessee.' Independent of what? Manifestly independent of all lawful authority---independent of and at war with the federal Constitution, which you have both sworn to support, protect, and defend.</p>
<p>What right has a citizen or officer to favor an `independent movement' at variance with the Constitution, and support the same by force of arms? What less is this than waging war against the Constitution of the United States, and the government established thereby? `An <span class="rend-i">independent movement</span>' against the Constitution, supported by a military governor by force of arms, recommended by an assembly calling itself a convention. Such in principle were the `independent movements' of governors and `portions of the people' which set at first in motion the great rebellion in the South with which we are contending. The `convention' calls upon a military governor to order an `independent movement' to help your re-election, and to support it by force of arms, placing `guards' around the ballot-box. And their recommendation is adopted by the military governor and `made' by him `part of his proclamation.' And yet you say, `I do not perceive in the plan any menace of coercion or violence toward any one.' Just so with the earlier `independent movement' of Governor [Isham G.] Harris in this state, which we opposed as we oppose this. There was no menace of coercion or violence toward any who should consent to see the Constitution violated and the `political plan' carried out without opposition. But the bayonet was kept in view, as it is in this case. Public meetings were menaced, and perhaps broken up by armed force. And so it is now. Those opposed to the `independent movement' were denounced as traitors, and so they are now. Troops from our own and from other states were used to overawe the people, and so they are now. We had vigilance committees and mob violence then. We have now secret leagues, and are liable at any time to arbitrary arrest, as well as to mob violence, which is now used in our midst.</p>
<p>``These are general facts, in support of which we add the following specifications: We have held a number of peaceable and loyal public meetings in this city, more than one of which has been `menaced' by your partisans. On the 21st instant such a meeting was held at the court-house in this city. It was held `peacefully' and conducted `loyally,' the assembly consisting chiefly of the `friends of George B. McClellan.' A number of provost guards were present, by request of those who conducted the meeting, to preserve order. The meeting had been addressed by a gentleman who is an exile from his home because of his loyalty, and who has spent much time in the military service of the government during the war. One of the undersigned, a McClellan elector (Hon. Balie Peyton), had taken the stand to address the meeting, when the hall was suddenly entered by a large party of soldiers, and the meeting violently broken up. These men rushed in with guns and drawn pistols, crying, `disperse you d---d rebels and traitors,' extinguishing the lights and driving the people from the hall.</p>
<p>``We specify further that on the 25th instant the rioters, thirty in number, published a card in the Nashville <span class="rend-i">Times</span>, the organ in this city of Governor Johnson, to which they append their names, as `all members of Company D, First Tennessee light artillery.' This company was raised and its officers appointed (as we understand) under the superintendence of Governor Johnson. The rioters speak thus in their card: `Neither Governor Johnson, nor any other individual outside of the men who were active participants, knew anything of our intention till the affair was over. Some colored men may have followed us, but we knew nothing of them.' `We do not fear a court-martial;' they defiantly add, `and therefore cheerfully give our names as loyal and Union-loving soldiers.'</p>
<p>``We specify further that on the evening of the 24th instant, only three days after the McClellan meeting was broken up, our streets were paraded by an immense procession of negroes, bearing torches and transparencies, with such inscriptions on the latter as `Lincoln and Johnson,' `Liberty or Death.' Some disorders occurred in connection with this demonstration, and shots were freely fired by the negroes---some at a window where white persons were standing, and some at persons on the streets. One of the latter (an employe of the government) was dangerously, if not mortally, wounded, and it was thought others were hit.</p>
<p>In the course of these orgies the procession waited on Governor Andrew Johnson, at the Capitol, and he delivered to the negro assembly an address. A report of his speech was published and republished in his organ, the <span class="rend-i">Times</span>, and from that report we take the following extract. Governor Johnson says:</p>
<p>`` `I speak to night as a citizen of Tennessee. I am here on my own soil, and mean to remain here, and fight this great battle of freedom through to the end. Loyal men, from this day forward, are to be the controllers of Tennessee's grand and sublime destiny, and rebels must be dumb. We will not listen to their counsels. Nashville is no longer the place for them to hold their meetings. Let them gather their treasonable conclaves elsewhere---among their friends in the confederacy. They shall not hold their conspiracies in Nashville.'</p>
<p>``The language of the rioters, `Disperse rebels and traitors,' and the common application of such terms of abuse and terror to the friends of General McClellan here, do not admit of our ignoring the meaning of Governor Johnson in the language quoted. The allusion is evidently to the riotous dispersion of our meeting three evenings previous. He also seems to adopt your idea that, as a citizen of Tennessee, he `has the right to favor any political plan he chooses.' And he unmistakably evinces his determination to `manage' his `side of this contest in his own way.'</p>
<p>`` `Governor Johnson,' you say, `like any other loyal citizen, has a right to favor any political plan he chooses.' We do not so read the duty of the citizen. Some of the political plans of our day are devised to overturn the Constitution and government of the United States---and this is one of them. The southern rebellion is another. Neither the citizens nor Governor Johnson has a right to favor such plans, unless it be upon the principle advanced by you as a member of Congress, that `any people, any where, being inclined, and having the power, have the right' to revolutionize, their government; that `this is a most valuable, a most <span class="rend-i">sacred</span> right.' We shall despair of the republic if these principles of anarchy, as embodied in you, shall be adopted by the people in your re-election.</p>
<p>``In the face of the reign of terror which has been established in Tennessee under the eyes of Governor Johnson, you say to us: `Do as you please, on your own account, peacefully and loyally, and Governor Johnson will not molest you, but will protect you against violence so far as is in his power.' If you mean that Governor Johnson will allow us to stay away from the polls without molestation, we trust there is some truth in your assurance. But if you mean to suggest that we hold separate elections `on our own account,' and to assure us that we shall not be molested but protected in such a `movement,' we know by experience, and by the facts above set forth, that your assurance is a cruel mockery. We will not advise our citizens to put in jeopardy their lives in going through the farce you propose, of holding an election under the laws at one ballot-box, while Governor Johnson holds an election under his `plan' at another. Too many unoffending citizens have already been murdered in our streets by negro soldiers---too many reputable women have been insulted by them. We do not wish to provoke further outrage. There will be no election for President in Tennessee in 1864. You and Governor Johnson may `manage your side of it in your own way,' but it will be no <span class="rend-i">election</span>.</p>
<p>``After consultation with our friends, therefore, in different parts of the state, and having communicated with nearly all of our colleagues, we respectfully announce to the people of Tennessee that in view of what is set forth above---in view of the fact that our people are overawed by military power, the laws set aside and violated with impunity---and in view of the fact that we have appealed in vain to the President whose duty it is to `see that the laws be faithfully executed,' and that those who act by his authority shall hold sacred the liberties of the people; in view of these things we announce that the McClellan electoral ticket in Tennessee is withdrawn. ``W. B. CAMPBELL, of Wilson county,</p>
<p>``Nashville, October 29.'' ``BAILIE PEYTON, of Sumner county,</p>

Found guilty and sentenced to confinement at hard labor during the war, Humphreys' sentence was remitted by General Alvin P. Hovey: `` . . . as the evidence does not show that . . .

<p>Gentlemen A petition has been presented to me on behalf of certain citizens of Allen and Barren counties in the State of Kentucky assuming that certain sums of money have been assessed and collected from them by the United States Military authorities, to compensate certain Union citizens of the same vicinage, for losses by rebel depredations, and praying that I will order the money to be refunded. The petition is accompanied by a letter of yours, which so presents the case as to induce me to make a brief response. You distinctly admit that the petitioners ``sympathize with the Confederate States &amp; regard them as warring to preserve their Constitutional &amp; legal rights.'' This admitted, it is scarcely possible to believe that they do not help the cause they thus love whenever they conveniently can. Their sons and relatives go into the rebel, but we may not be able to distinctly prove that they out-fitted, and sent them. When armed rebels come among them, their houses and other property are spared; while Union men's houses are burned, and their property pillaged. Still we may not be able to specifically prove that the sympathizers, protected and supplied the raiders in turn, or designated their Union nei[g]hbors for plunder and devastation. Yet we know all this exists even better than we could know an isolated fact upon the sworn testimony of one or two witnesses, just as we better know there is fire whence we see much smoke rising than could know it by one or two witnesses swearing to it. The witnesses may commit perjury, but the smoke<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;78</span>
can not. Now, experience has already taught us in this war that holding these smoky localities responsible for the conflagrations within them has a very salutary effect. It was obviously so in and about St. Louis, and on Eastern Shore of Virginia.</p>

<p>It is represented to me that an officer has, by your authority, assessed and collected considerable sums of money from citizens of Allen and Barren counties, Kentucky, to compensate Union men for depredations committed upon them in the vicinity by rebels; and I am petitioned to order the money to be refunded. At most I could not do this without hearing both sides, which, as yet, I have not. I write now to say, that, in my opinion, in some extreme cases, this class of proceedings becomes a necessity; but that it is liable to---almost inseparable from---great abuses, and therefore should only be sparingly resorted to, and be conducted with great caution; that you, in your department, must be the judge of the proper localities and occasions for applying it; and that it will be well for you to see that your subordinates be at all times ready to account for every dollar, as to why collected, of whom, and how applied. Without this, you will soon find some of them making assessments and collections merely to put money in their own pockets, and it will also be impossible to correct errors in future and better times.</p>
<p>In the case I have mentioned, such good men as Hon. J. R. Underwood &amp; Hon. Henry Grider though not personally interested, have appealed to me in behalf of others. So soon as you can, consistently with your other duties, I will thank you to acquaint yourself with the particulars of this case, and make any correction which may seem to be proper.

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; AES, DLC-Stanton Papers. Lincoln's endorsement is written on a telegram to Stanton received on November 5 from General Benjamin F. Butler, who had been sent to New York with troops to maintain order until after the election:<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;92</span></p>
<p>``I desire to issue the following portion of an order about Brig Genl John A. Green as commander of the District of New York.</p>
<p>``Gen Dix objects not on account of any difference as to jurisdiction between us but because he thinks we have no power to touch Green &amp; desires me to ask you.</p>
<p>``Will you sanction it?</p>
<p>`` `There can be no military organization in any state known to the laws save the militia &amp; armies of the United States. The president is the constitutional Comdr in chief of the militia &amp; army of the U.S. therefore where in any portion of the U.S. an officer of superior rank is detailed to command all other military officers in that district must report to &amp; be subordinate to him therefore all persons exercising any military authority in this District will at once report to these HdQuarters for orders A military order purporting to be issued by Br Genl John A Green is countermanded &amp; revoked &amp; Brig Genl Green if exercising any military command will forthwith report to these Hd Qurs &amp; any attempt to exercise military authority without so reporting will be summarily punished as wilful disobedience of orders.'</p>
<p>``I will wait for answer at the telegraph officer Troops are beginning to arrive.'' (Telegram, DLC-Stanton Papers; OR, I, XLIII, II, 549-50).</p>
<p>Stanton replied on the same day: ``Your telegram has been submitted to the consideration of the President, and all action upon the subject-matter will be suspended until his instructions are received.'' (OR, I, XLIII, II, 550).</p>
<p>On November 7 Stanton telegraphed Butler: ``The President thinks it expedient to avoid precipitating any military collision between the United States forces and the militia of the State of New York; and as General Dix, the commanding officer of the department, does not approve of the order proposed by you to be issued, in reference to the militia of the State and Brigadier-General Green, the President is of the opinion that it had better not be issued. If Green, under any color of pretense, should undertake to resist the military authority of the United States, he may then be dealt with as circumstances require, without any general order that may become the subject of abstract discussion.'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>., p. 568).</p>
<p>This exchange of telegrams grew out of an order issued on October 29 by Brigadier General John A. Green, Jr., commanding the New York State Militia, which reads in part as follows: ``The General-Commanding recognizes danger to the public peace in the proposed attempt of a Major-General holding a commission under the Federal Government to take under his care and supervision within the . . . district, the election to be held as aforesaid.

Hamilton for bringing out cotton. . . . He said that the scheme was one by which certain important persons in the Rebel cause were to be converted. Had himself not much faith that it would amount to anything, and yet it might. The President believed there would be results; but had been very confidential and secret in all that was done. He (S.) had drawn up the order carefully by special request of the President, but had never communicated to any one but Stanton what had been done. . . . I remarked that the subject was of a character which seemed to deserve general consultation in the Cabinet . . . that I was especially so, it being my special duty to prevent intercourse with the Rebels and enforce the blockade. But this order conflicted with that duty, was not in good faith, I apprehended, with others of our people, or with foreign powers. I told him I had made inquiries of Fessenden, for the order expressly referred to the Treasury agents, and they would of course report to him. Seward<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;94</span></p>
<p>said there was no interference with the blockade. He had prepared the order with great care and sent one copy to General Canby, and one to Admiral Farragut, and proposed to send and get it for my perusal. I told him I already had a copy, which seemed to surprise him. . . . He appeared not to be aware that . . . all the three Departments must come into possession of this confidential circular, and not unlikely it would go into the courts. He is not yet dispossessed of his early error that the government can be carried on by executive order regardless of Department or laws.''</p>

<p>FRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS: Even before I had been informed by you that this compliment was paid me by loyal citizens of Pennsylvania friendly to me, I had inferred that you were of that portion of my countrymen who think that the best interests of the nation are to be subserved by the support of the present Administration. I do not pretend to say that you who think so embrace all the patriotism and loyalty of the country. But I do believe, and I trust, without personal interest, that the welfare of the country does require that such support and indorsement be given. I earnestly believe that the consequences of this day's work, if it be as you assure me and as now seems probable, will be to the lasting advantage, if not to the very salvation, of the country. I cannot at this hour say what has been the result of the election; but, whatever it may be, I have no desire to modify this opinion---that all who have labored to-day in behalf of the Union organization, have wrought for the best interests of their country and the world, not only for the present, but for all future ages. I am thankful to God for this approval of the people. But while deeply grateful for this mark of their confidence in me, if I know my heart, my gratitude is free from any taint of personal triumph. I do not impugn the motives of any one opposed to me. It is no pleasure to me to triumph over any one; but I give thanks to the Almighty for this evidence of the people's resolution to stand by free government and the rights of humanity.</p>

<div class="opener">November 10, 1864</div>
<p>It has long been a grave question whether any government, not <span class="rend-i">too</span> strong for the liberties of its people, can be strong <span class="rend-i">enough</span> to maintain its own existence, in great emergencies.</p>
<p>On this point the present rebellion brought our republic to a severe test; and a presidential election occurring in regular course during the rebellion added not a little to the strain. If the loyal people, <span class="rend-i">united</span>, were put to the utmost of their strength by the rebellion, must they not fail when <span class="rend-i">divided</span>, and partially paralized, by a political war among themselves?</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;101</span>But the election was a necessity.</p>
<p>We can not have free government without elections; and if the rebellion could force us to forego, or postpone a national election, it might fairly claim to have already conquered and ruined us. The strife of the election is but human-nature practically applied to the facts of the case. What has occurred in this case, must ever recur in similar cases. Human-nature will not change. In any future great national trial, compared with the men of this, we shall have as weak, and as strong; as silly and as wise; as bad and good. Let us, therefore, study the incidents of this, as philosophy to learn wisdom from, and none of them as wrongs to be revenged.</p>
<p>But the election, along with its incidental, and undesirable strife, has done good too. It has demonstrated that a people's government can sustain a national election, in the midst of a great civil war. Until now it has not been known to the world that this was a possibility. It shows also how <span class="rend-i">sound</span>, and how <span class="rend-i">strong</span> we still are. It shows that, even among candidates of the same party, he who is most devoted to the Union, and most opposed to treason, can receive most of the people's votes. It shows also, to the extent yet known, that we have more men now, than we had when the war began. Gold is good in its place; but living, brave, patriotic men, are better than gold.</p>
<p>But the rebellion continues; and now that the election is over, may not all, having a common interest, re-unite in a common effort, to save our common country? For my own part I have striven, and shall strive to avoid placing any obstacle in the way. So long as I have been here I have not willingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom.</p>
<p>While I am deeply sensible to the high compliment of a re-election; and duly grateful, as I trust, to Almighty God for having directed my countrymen to a right conclusion, as I think, for their own good, it adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be disappointed or pained by the result.</p>
<p>May I ask those who have not differed with me, to join with me, in this same spirit towards those who have?</p>
<p>And now, let me close by asking three hearty cheers for our brave soldiers and seamen and their gallant and skilful commanders.</p>

<span class="rend-i">Private</span> Executive Mansion
Major General Hurlbut Washington, Nov. 14. 1864</div>
<p>Few things, since I have been here, have impressed me more painfully than what, for four or five months past, has appeared as bitter military opposition to the new State Government of Louisiana. I still indulged some hope that I was mistaken in the fact; but<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;107</span>
copies of a correspondence on the subject, between Gen. Canby and yourself, and shown me to-day, dispel that hope. A very fair proportion of the people of Louisiana have inaugerated a new State Government, making an excellent new constitution---better for the poor black man than we have in Illinois. This was done under military protection, directed by me, in the belief, still sincerely entertained, that with such a nucleous around which to build, we could get the State into position again sooner than otherwise. In this belief a general promise of protection and support, applicable alike to Louisiana and other states, was given in the last annual message. During the formation of the new government and constitution, they were supported by nearly every loyal person and opposed by every secessionist. And this support, and this opposition, from the respective stand points of the parties, was perfectly consistent and logical. Every Unionist ought to wish the new government to succeed; and every disunionist must desire it to fail. It's failure would gladden the heart of Slidell in Europe, and of every enemy of the old flag in the world. Every advocate of slavery naturally desires to see blasted, and crushed, the liberty promised the black man by the new constitution. But why Gen. Canby and Gen. Hurlbut should join on the same side is to me incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Of course, in the condition of things at New-Orleans, the military must not be thwarted by the civil authority; but when the constitutional convention, for what it deems a breach of previlege, arrests an editor, in no way connected with the military, the military necessity for insulting the Convention, and forcibly discharging the editor, is difficult to perceive.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_107_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_107_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> Neither is the military necessity for protecting the people against paying large salaries, fixed by a Legislature of their own choosing, very apparant. Equally difficult to perceive is the military necessity for forcibly interposing to prevent a bank from loaning it's own money to the State. These things, if they have occurred, are, at the best, no better than gratuitous hostility. I wish I could hope that they may be shown to not have occurred. To make assurance against misunderstanding, I repeat that in the existing condition of things in Louisiana, the military must not be thwarted by the civil authority; and I add that on points of difference the commanding general must be judge and master. But I also add that in the exercise of this judgment and control, a purpose, obvious, and scarcely unavowed, to transcend all military necessity, in order to crush out the civil government, will not be overlooked. Yours truly A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADfS, DLC-RTL; LS, DLC. The correspondence between General Edward R. S. Canby and Hurlbut may be found in OR, I, XLI, IV, 412-13. In reply to<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;108</span></p>
<p>Hurlbut's question ``to what extent am I compelled . . . to recognize the acts and proceedings of the State of Louisiana in its several branches. . . .'' Canby replied on October 29, ``It is scarcely necessary for me to say that until the President . . . revokes his proclamation of December 8, 1863, or until Congress has acted definitely upon the subject, all attempts at civil government, within the territory declared to be in insurrection, are the creation of military power, and, of course, subject to military revision and control. . . .''</p>
<p>On November 29, Hurlbut replied to LINCOLN's letter:</p>
<p>``I am this day in receipt of your letter of November 14th. I confess myself much surprised at the tenor and spirit of its contents and am well assured that correct information has not been furnished you of the position either of Genl Canby or myself.</p>
<p>``I recognize as thoroughly as any man the advance toward the right made by the adoption of the Free Constitution of Louisiana, and have done and shall do all in my power to vindicate its declaration of freedom, and to protect and prepare the emancipated Bondsmen for their new status &amp; condition. The fact has been withheld from you, Mr President, but it still exists that nothing has been done for this purpose since the adoption of the Constitution---<span class="rend-i">except by military authority</span>. . . .''

<p>The President, in reply, said: ``He had to confess that he was fully notified of the intention thus kindly to call upon him, and by that means he had a fair opportunity offered to be ready with a set speech; but he had not prepared one, having been very busy with his public duties; therefore, he could only speak as the thoughts might occur to him. He would not attempt to conceal from them the fact that he was gratified at the results of the Presidential election, and he would assure them that he had kept as near as he could to the exercise of his best judgment, for the promotion of the interests of the whole country; and now, to have the seal of approbation marked on the course he had pursued was exceedingly gratifying to his feelings. He might go further and say that, in as large proportion as any other man, his pleasure consisted in the belief that the policy he had pursued would be the best and the only one that could save the country. He had said before, and would now repeat, that he indulged in no feeling of triumph over any one who thought or acted differently from himself. He had no such feeling towards any living man.</p>
<p>``When he thought of Maryland in particular, it was that the people had more than double their share in what had occurred in the elections. He thought the adoption of their free State constitution was a bigger thing than their part in the Presidential election. He could, any day, have stipulated to lose Maryland in the Presidential election to save its free constitution, because the Presidential election comes every four years and the adoption of the constitution, being a good thing, could not be undone. He therefore thought in that they had a victory for the right worth a great deal more than their part in the Presidential election, although he thought well of that. He once before said, and would now say again, that those who had differed from us and opposed us would see that it was better for their own good that they had been defeated, rather than to have been successful. Thanking them for<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;114</span>
their compliment, he said he would bring to a close that short speech.''</p>

<p>A Proclamation.</p>
<p>Whereas, by my Proclamation of the nineteenth of April, one thousand eight hundred and sixty one, it was declared that the ports of certain States including those of Norfolk, in the State of Virginia, Fernandina and Pensacola, in the State of Florida, were, for reasons therein set forth, intended to be placed under blockade; and whereas the said ports were subsequently blockaded accordingly, but having, for some time past, been in the military possession of the United States, it is deemed advisable that they should be opened to domestic and foreign commerce:</p>
<p>Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, pursuant to the authority in me vested by the fifth section of the act of Congress, approved on the 13th. of July 1861, entitled ``An act further to provide for the collection of duties on imports and for other purposes,'' do hereby declare that the blockade of the said ports of Norfolk, Fernandina and Pensacola, shall so far cease and determine from and after the first day of December next that commercial intercourse with those ports, except as to persons, things and information contraband of war, may, from that time, be carried on, subject to the laws of the United States, to the limitations and in pursuance of the regulations which may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and to such military and naval regulations as are now in force or may hereafter be found necessary.</p>
<p>In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>Done at the city of Washington, this nineteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty four, and of the Independence of the United States the eighty-ninth.</p>

The purported facsimiles of this letter have long been adjudged to be forgeries, but there is no reason to question the authenticity of the text of the letter which appeared in the <span class="rend-i">Transcript</span> and other contemporary sources. Controversy over the claim that John Hay composed this letter has somewhat abated, with the claim remaining unproved. Lincoln was in error as to Mrs. Bixby's five sons because her case had been inaccurately presented to him by the Adjutant General's Office. Later investigations have revealed that only two sons were killed: Sergeant Charles N. Bixby, Twentieth Massachusetts Infantry, killed May 3, 1863, and Private Oliver C. Bixby, Fifty-eighth Massachusetts Infantry, killed July 30, 1864. Private George W. (A.?) Way (Bixby), Fifty-sixth Massachusetts Infantry, who had enlisted under an assumed name, was captured July 30, 1864. Imprisoned first at Richmond and later at Salisbury, North Carolina, George Way was reported (1) to have deserted to the enemy and (2) to have died in prison at Salisbury. Neither of these reports has been established beyond doubt. Corporal Henry C. Bixby, Thirty-second Massachusetts Infantry, was honorably discharged at Boston on December 17, 1864. Private Edward (Arthur Edward) Bixby, First Massachusetts Heavy Artillery, deserted May 28 or 29, 1862.

<p>A communication from General Stephen G. Burbridge to Colonel Norton P. Chipman, November 23, 1864, gives the reasons for Jacob's arrest: ``Lieutenant-Governor Jacob was arrested for making speeches in Kentucky, in which he advised armed resistance to the enrollment and enlistment of slaves; advised citizens to arm to resist military interference at the polls; and generally his whole conduct and speeches have been wholly disloyal. . . .''

Morgan's command was one of a group of rebels who went to Chicago during the Democratic Convention, with plans, it was charged, to release prisoners of war and to assist the Sons of Liberty in a ``North-western Insurrection.'' (OR, I, XLV, I, 1077, Colonel Benjamin J. Sweet to James B. Fry, November 26, 1864). He was captured and held in close confinement as a spy at Camp Morton. After being transferred to Point Lookout and later to the Old Capitol Prison in Washington, Castleman was returned on April 28, 1865, to Hovey's command at Indianapolis, where he was to be tried (OR, II, VIII, 87, 477, 511, 519). He was released without trial, however, on condition that he leave the United States.</p>
<p>According to an article accompanying the facsimile published in the Louisville <span class="rend-i">Post</span>, Lincoln gave his order of November 29 to Judge Samuel M. Breckinridge, of St. Louis, Missouri, whose wife was Virginia Castleman, sister of John B. Castleman, with the comment, ``Sam, this is for you and Virginia, entrusted in confidence, with the condition that its existence shall not be known unless the emergency arises for which this letter provides.'' Castleman's banishment lasted for eighteen months, and he never knew of Lincoln's order until the original was given to him by his brother-in-law fifteen years later.</p>

The memory of that kindness &amp; personal favor, I shall bear with me into private life, and hope to retain it in my heart, as long as I live.</p>
<p>``Pray let my resignation take effect on the last day of November</p>
<p>``With heartfelt respect I remain your friend &amp; servant'' (<span class="rend-i">ibid</span>.).</p>
<p>On November 30, Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt declined to accept appointment as Bates' successor: ``I have with your permission, held under consideration until this moment, the offer of the office of Attorney General of the U.States, so kindly made to me a few days since. The result is that after the most careful reflection, I have not been able to overcome the embarrassments referred to in our last interview, &amp; which then disinclined me to accept, as they<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;127</span>
must now determine me respectfully to decline the appointment. . . . In view of all the circumstances, I am satisfied that I can serve you better in the position which I now hold at your hands. . . .'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>.).</p>
<p>On December 1, Holt recommended the appointment of James Speed: ``Referring to our conversation of yesterday, I beg to say that the opinion there expressed in regard to Mr S. remains unchanged. I can recall no public man in the State, of <span class="rend-i">uncompromising loyalty</span>, who unites in the same degree, the qualifications of professional attainments, fervent devotion to the union, &amp; to the principles of your administration &amp; spotless points of personal character. To these he adds---what I should deem indispensable---a warm &amp; hearty friendship for yourself, personally &amp; officially.'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>.).</p>

<p>A war steamer called the 'Funayma Solace,' having been built in this country for the Japanese government and at the instance<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;132</span>
of that government, it is deemed to comport with the public interest, in view of the unsettled condition of the relations of the United States with that Empire, that the steamer should not be allowed to proceed to Japan. If, however, the Secretary of the Navy should ascertain that the steamer is adapted to our service, he is authorized to purchase her, but the purchase money will be held in trust towards satisfying any valid claims which may be presented by the Japanese on account of the construction of the steamer and the failure to deliver the same as above set forth.</p>

Gideon Welles' <span class="rend-i">Diary</span> under dates November 30 and December 3, 1864, gives an account of the conferences leading up to Lincoln's issuance of this order of December 3. Under date of December 5 Welles wrote: ``Mr. Seward sent for my perusal a draught of an executive order forbidding the Japanese vessel from leaving, and authorizing the Navy Department to purchase. I dislike this thing in every aspect. . . . Some weeks since application was made for a survey and appraisal of this vessel. This was ordered . . . and without any connection with the government or the Japanese. The Board valued her at $392,000, and at this price we, under direction of the President at the solicitation of Seward, agreed to take her. These late government movements make it embarrassing. I declined to give any opinion or make any suggestion in regard to the executive order, but said orally to the clerk that our offer was still considered as good. . . . Two hundred thousand dollars in gold would purchase this vessel. It is easy to perceive that Mr. [Thurlow] Weed and Mr. [Robert H.] Pruyn will realize a clever sum for their labors. They have had for one or two years the use of $800,000 in gold. This vessel has not cost them over $200,000 in gold. The government takes it at $392,000 and must pay that sum in gold to Japan. Who pockets the $192,000? It cannot be otherwise than that this subject will be inquired into. It ought to be.''</p>

<p>In conformity to the Law of 11 July 1862. I most cordially recommend that Lieutenant Wm. B. Cushing, U.S. Navy, receive a vote of Thanks from Congress, for his important, gallant and perilous achievement in destroying the Rebel iron-clad Steamer ``Albemarle,'' on the night of the 27 October 1864, at Plymouth, N.C.

<div class="opener">Fellow-citizens of the Senate December 6, 1864</div>
<p>and House of Representatives:</p>
<p>Again the blessings of health and abundant harvests claim our profoundest gratitude to Almighty God.</p>
<p>The condition of our foreign affairs is reasonably satisfactory.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_136_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_136_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;137</span>Mexico continues to be a theatre of civil war. While our political relations with that country have undergone no change, we have, at the same time, strictly maintained neutrality between the belligerents.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_137_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_137_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span></p>
<p>At the request of the states of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, a competent engineer has been authorized to make a survey of the river San Juan and the port of San Juan. It is a source of much satisfaction that the difficulties which for a moment excited some political apprehensions, and caused a closing of the inter-oceanic transit route, have been amicably adjusted, and that there is a good prospect that the route will soon be reopened with an increase of capacity and adaptation.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_137_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_137_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[4]</a></span> We could not exaggerate either the commercial or the political importance of that great improvement.</p>
<p>It would be doing injustice to an important South American state not to acknowledge the directness, frankness, and cordiality with which the United States of Colombia have entered into intimate relations with this government. A claims convention has been constituted to complete the unfinished work of the one which closed its session in 1861.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_137_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_137_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[5]</a></span>.</p>
<p>The new liberal constitution of Venezuela having gone into effect with the universal acquiescence of the people, the government under it has been recognized, and diplomatic intercourse with it has opened in a cordial and friendly spirit. The long-deferred Aves Island claim has been satisfactorily paid and discharged.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_137_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_137_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[6]</a></span></p>
<p>Mutual payments have been made of the claims awarded by the late joint commission for the settlement of claims between the United States and Peru.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_137_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_137_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[7]</a></span> An earnest and cordial friendship continues to exist between the two countries, and such efforts as were<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;138</span>
in my power have been used to remove misunderstanding and avert a threatened war between Peru and Spain.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_138_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_138_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[8]</a></span>.</p>
<p>Our relations are of the most friendly nature with Chile, the Argentine Republic, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Paraguay, San Salvador, and Hayti.</p>
<p>During the past year no differences of any kind have arisen with any of those republics, and, on the other hand, their sympathies with the United States are constantly expressed with cordiality and earnestness.</p>
<p>The claim arising from the seizure of the cargo of the brig Macedonian in 1821 has been paid in full by the government of Chile.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_138_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_138_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[9]</a></span></p>
<p>Civil war continues in the Spanish part of San Domingo, apparently without prospect of an early close.</p>
<p>Official correspondence has been freely opened with Liberia, and it gives us a pleasing view of social and political progress in that Republic. It may be expected to derive new vigor from American influence, improved by the rapid disappearance of slavery in the United States.</p>
<p>I solicit your authority to furnish to the republic a gunboat at moderate cost, to be reimbursed to the United States by instalments.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_138_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_138_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[10]</a></span> Such a vessel is needed for the safety of that state against the native African races; and in Liberian hands it would be more effective in arresting the African slave trade than a squadron in our own hands. The possession of the least organized naval force would stimulate a generous ambition in the republic, and the confidence which we should manifest by furnishing it would win forbearance and favor towards the colony from all civilized nations.</p>
<p>The proposed overland telegraph between America and Europe,<span class="ptr"><a name="8_138_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_138_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[11]</a></span> by the way of Behring's Straits and Asiatic Russia, which was sanctioned by Congress at the last session, has been undertaken, under very favorable circumstances, by an association of American citizens, with the cordial good-will and support as well of this government as of those of Great Britain and Russia. Assurances<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;139</span>
have been received from most of the South American States of their high appreciation of the enterprise, and their readiness to co-operate in constructing lines tributary to that world-encircling communication. I learn, with much satisfaction, that the noble design of a telegraphic communication between the eastern coast of America and Great Britain has been renewed with full expectation of its early accomplishment.</p>
<p>Thus it is hoped that with the return of domestic peace the country will be able to resume with energy and advantage its former high career of commerce and civilization.</p>
<p>Our very popular and estimable representative in Egypt died in April last.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_139_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_139_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[12]</a></span> An unpleasant altercation which arose between the temporary incumbent of the office and the government of the Pacha resulted in a suspension of intercourse. The evil was promptly corrected on the arrival of the successor in the consulate, and our relations with Egypt, as well as our relations with the Barbary powers, are entirely satisfactory.</p>
<p>The rebellion which has so long been flagrant in China, has at last been suppressed, with the co-operating good offices of this government, and of the other western commercial states.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_139_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_139_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[13]</a></span> The judicial consular establishment there has become very difficult and onerous, and it will need legislative revision to adapt it to the extension of our commerce, and to the more intimate intercourse which has been instituted with the government and people of that vast empire. China seems to be accepting with hearty good-will the conventional laws which regulate commercial and social intercourse among the western nations.</p>
<p>Owing to the peculiar situation of Japan, and the anomalous form of its government, the action of that empire in performing treaty stipulations is inconstant and capricious.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_139_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_139_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[14]</a></span> Nevertheless, good progress has been effected by the western powers, moving with enlightened concert. Our own pecuniary claims have been allowed, or put in course of settlement, and the inland sea has been reopened to commerce. There is reason also to believe that these proceedings have increased rather than diminished the friendship of Japan towards the United States.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;140</span>The ports of Norfolk, Fernandina, and Pensacola have been opened by proclamation.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_140_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_140_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[15]</a></span> It is hoped that foreign merchants will now consider whether it is not safer and more profitable to themselves, as well as just to the United States, to resort to these and other open ports, than it is to pursue, through many hazards, and at vast cost, a contraband trade with other ports which are closed, if not by actual military occupation, at least by a lawful and effective blockade.</p>
<p>For myself, I have no doubt of the power and duty of the Executive, under the law of nations, to exclude enemies of the human race from an asylum in the United States. If Congress should think that proceedings in such cases lack the authority of law, or ought to be further regulated by it, I recommend that provision be made for effectually preventing foreign slave traders from acquiring domicile and facilities for their criminal occupation in our country.</p>
<p>It is possible that, if it were a new and open question, the maritime powers, with the lights they now enjoy, would not concede the privileges of a naval belligerent to the insurgents of the United States, destitute, as they are, and always have been, equally of ships-of-war and of ports and harbors. Disloyal emissaries have been neither less assiduous nor more successful during the last year than they were before that time in their efforts, under favor of that privilege, to embroil our country in foreign wars. The desire and determination of the governments of the maritime states to defeat that design are believed to be as sincere as, and cannot be more earnest than our own. Nevertheless, unforeseen political difficulties have arisen, especially in Brazilian and British ports,<span class="ptr"><a name="8_140_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_140_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[16]</a></span> and on the northern boundary of the United States, which have required, and are likely to continue to require, the practice of constant vigilance, and a just and conciliatory spirit on the part of the United States as well as of the nations concerned and their governments.</p>
<p>Commissioners have been appointed under the treaty with Great Britain on the adjustment of the claims of the Hudson's Bay and Puget's Sound Agricultural Companies, in Oregon, and are now proceeding to the execution of the trust assigned to them.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_140_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_140_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[17]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;141</span>In view of the insecurity of life and property in the region adjacent to the Canadian border,<span class="ptr"><a name="8_141_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_141_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[18]</a></span> by reason of recent assaults and depredations committed by inimical and desperate persons, who are harbored there, it has been thought proper to give notice that after the expiration of six months, the period conditionally stipulated in the existing arrangement with Great Britain, the United States must hold themselves at liberty to increase their naval armament upon the lakes, if they shall find that proceeding necessary. The condition of the border will necessarily come into consideration in connection with the question of continuing or modifying the rights of transit from Canada through the United States, as well as the regulation of imposts, which were temporarily established by the reciprocity treaty of the 5th of June, 1854.</p>
<p>I desire, however, to be understood, while making this statement, that the Colonial authorities of Canada are not deemed to be intentionally unjust or unfriendly towards the United States; but, on the contrary, there is every reason to expect that, with the approval of the imperial government, they will take the necessary measures to prevent new incursions across the border.</p>
<p>The act passed at the last session for the encouragement of emigration has, so far as was possible, been put into operation. It seems to need amendment which will enable the officers of the government to prevent the practice of frauds against the immigrants while on their way and on their arrival in the ports, so as to secure them here a free choice of avocations and places of settlement.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_141_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_141_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[19]</a></span> A liberal disposition towards this great national policy is manifested by most of the European States, and ought to be reciprocated on our part by giving the immigrants effective national protection. I regard our emigrants as one of the principal replenishing streams which are appointed by Providence to repair the ravages of internal war, and its wastes of national strength and health. All that is necessary is to secure the flow of that stream in its present fullness, and to that end the government must, in every way, make it manifest that it neither needs nor designs to impose involuntary military service upon those who come from other lands to cast their lot in our country.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;142</span>The financial affairs of the government have been successfully administered during the last year.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_142_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_142_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[20]</a></span> The legislation of the last session of Congress has beneficially affected the revenues, although sufficient time has not yet elapsed to experience the full effect of several of the provisions of the acts of Congress imposing increased taxation.</p>
<p>The receipts during the year, from all sources, upon the basis of warrants signed by the Secretary of the Treasury, including loans and the balance in the treasury on the first day of July, 1863, were $1,394,796,007 62; and the aggregate disbursements, upon the same basis, were $1,298,056,101 89, leaving a balance in the treasury, as shown by warrants, of $96,739,905 73.</p>
<p>Deduct from these amounts the amount of the principal of the public debt redeemed, and the amount of issues in substitution therefor, and the actual cash operations of the treasury were: receipts, $884,076,646 57; disbursements $865,234,087 86; which leaves a cash balance in the treasury of $18,842,558 71.</p>
<p>Of the receipts, there were derived from customs, $102,316,152 99; from lands, $588,333 29; from direct taxes, $475,648 96; from internal revenue, $109,741,134 10; from miscellaneous sources, $47,511,448 10; and from loans applied to actual expenditures, including former balance, $623,443,929 13.</p>
<p>There were disbursed, for the civil service, $27,505,599 46; for pensions and Indians, $7,517,930 97; for the War Department $690,791,842 97; for the Navy Department $85,733,292 77; for interest of the public debt $53,685,421 69;---making an aggregate of $865,234,087.86, and leaving a balance in the treasury of $18,842,558.71, as before stated.</p>
<p>For the actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarter, and the estimated receipts and disbursements for the three remaining quarters of the current fiscal year, and the general operations of the treasury in detail, I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. I concur with him in the opinion that the proportion of moneys required to meet the expenses consequent upon the war derived from taxation should be still further increased; and I earnestly invite your attention to this subject, to the end that there may be such additional legislation as shall be required to meet the just expectations of the Secretary.</p>
<p>The public debt on the first day of July last, as appears by the books of the treasury, amounted to $1,740,690 489 49. Probably, should the war continue for another year, that amount may be increased<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;143</span>
by not far from five hundred millions. Held as it is, for the most part, by our own people, it has become a substantial branch of national, though private, property. For obvious reasons, the more nearly this property can be distributed among all the people the better. To favor such general distribution, greater inducements to become owners might, perhaps, with good effect, and without injury, be presented to persons of limited means. With this view, I suggest whether it might not be both competent and expedient for Congress to provide that a limited amount of some future issue of public securities might be held by any bona fide purchaser exempt from taxation, and from seizure for debt, under such restrictions and limitations as might be necessary to guard against abuse of so important a privilege. This would enable every prudent person to set aside a small annuity against a possible day of want.</p>
<p>Privileges like these would render the possession of such securities, to the amount limited, most desirable to every person of small means who might be able to save enough for the purpose. The great advantage of citizens being creditors as well as debtors, with relation to the public debt, is obvious. Men readily perceive that they cannot be much oppressed by a debt which they owe to themselves.</p>
<p>The public debt on the first day of July last, although somewhat exceeding the estimate of the Secretary of the Treasury made to Congress at the commencement of the last session, falls short of the estimate of that officer made in the preceding December, as to its probable amount at the beginning of this year, by the sum of $3,995,097 31. This fact exhibits a satisfactory condition and conduct of the operations of the Treasury.</p>
<p>The national banking system is proving to be acceptable to capitalists and to the people. On the twenty-fifth day of November five hundred and eighty-four national banks had been organized, a considerable number of which were conversions from State banks. Changes from State systems to the national system are rapidly taking place, and it is hoped that, very soon, there will be in the United States, no banks of issue not authorized by Congress, and no bank-note circulation not secured by the government. That the government and the people will derive great benefit from this change in the banking systems of the country can hardly be questioned. The national system will create a reliable and permanent influence in support of the national credit, and protect the people against losses in the use of paper money. Whether or not any further legislation is advisable for the suppression of State bank issues, it will be for Congress to determine. It seems quite clear that the treasury cannot be satisfactorily conducted unless the government<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;144</span>
can exercise a restraining power over the bank-note circulation of the country.</p>
<p>The report of the Secretary of War<span class="ptr"><a name="8_144_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_144_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[21]</a></span> and the accompanying documents will detail the campaigns of the armies in the field since the date of the last annual message, and also the operations of the several administrative bureaus of the War Department during the last year. It will also specify the measures deemed essential for the national defence, and to keep up and supply the requisite military force.</p>
<p>The report of the Secretary of the Navy presents a comprehensive and satisfactory exhibit of the affairs of that Department and of the naval service.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_144_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_144_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[22]</a></span> It is a subject of congratulation and laudable pride to our countrymen that a navy of such vast proportions has been organized in so brief a period, and conducted with so much efficiency and success.</p>
<p>The general exhibit of the navy, including vessels under construction on the 1st. of December, 1864, shows a total of 671 vessels, carrying 4,610 guns, and of 510,396 tons, being an actual increase during the year, over and above all losses by shipwreck or in battle, of 83 vessels, 167 guns, and 42,427 tons.</p>
<p>The total number of men at this time in the naval service, including officers, is about 51,000.</p>
<p>There have been captured by the navy during the year 324 vessels, and the whole number of naval captures since hostilities commenced is 1,379, of which 267 are steamers.</p>
<p>The gross proceeds arising from the sale of condemned prize property, thus far reported, amount to $14,396,250 51. A large amount of such proceeds is still under adjudication and yet to be reported.</p>
<p>The total expenditures of the Navy Department of every description, including the cost of the immense squadrons that have been called into existence from the 4th of March, 1861, to the 1st. of November, 1864, are $238,647,262 35.</p>
<p>Your favorable consideration is invited to the various recommendations of the Secretary of the Navy, especially in regard to a navy yard and suitable establishment for the construction and repair of iron vessels, and the machinery and armature for our ships, to which reference was made in my last annual message.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_144_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_144_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[23]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;145</span>Your attention is also invited to the views expressed in the report in relation to the legislation of Congress at its last session in respect to prize on our inland waters.</p>
<p>I cordially concur in the recommendation of the Secretary as to the propriety of creating the new rank of vice-admiral in our naval service.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_145_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_145_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>Your attention is invited to the report of the Postmaster General for a detailed account of the operations and financial condition of the Post Office Department.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_145_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_145_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[25]</a></span></p>
<p>The postal revenues for the year ending June 30, 1864, amounted to $12,438,253.78 and the expenditures to $12,644,786.20; the excess of expenditures over receipts being $206,652.42 [$206,532.42].</p>
<p>The views presented by the Postmaster General on the subject of special grants by the government in aid of the establishment of new lines of ocean mail steamships and the policy he recommends for the development of increased commercial intercourse with adjacent and neighboring countries, should receive the careful consideration of Congress.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_145_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_145_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[26]</a></span></p>
<p>It is of noteworthy interest that the steady expansion of population, improvement and governmental institutions over the new and unoccupied portions of our country have scarcely been checked, much less impeded or destroyed, by our great civil war, which at first glance would seem to have absorbed almost the entire energies of the nation.</p>
<p>The organization and admission of the State of Nevada has been completed in conformity with law,<span class="ptr"><a name="8_145_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_145_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[27]</a></span> and thus our excellent system is firmly established in the mountains, which once seemed a barren and uninhabitable waste between the Atlantic States and those which have grown up on the coast of the Pacific ocean.</p>
<p>The territories of the Union are generally in a condition of prosperity and rapid growth.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_145_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_145_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[28]</a></span> Idaho and Montana, by reason of their great distance and the interruption of communication with them by Indian hostilities, have been only partially organized; but it is understood that these difficulties are about to disappear, which will permit their governments, like those of the others, to go into speedy and full operation.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;146</span>As intimately connected with, and promotive of, this material growth of the nation, I ask the attention of Congress to the valuable information and important recommendations relating to the public lands, Indian affairs, the Pacific railroad, and mineral discoveries contained in the report of the Secretary of the Interior, which is herewith transmitted, and which report also embraces the subjects of patents, pensions and other topics of public interest pertaining to his department.</p>
<p>The quantity of public land disposed of during the five quarters ending on the 30th of September last was 4,221,342 acres, of which 1,538,614 acres were entered under the homestead law. The remainder was located with military land warrants, agricultural scrip certified to States for railroads, and sold for cash. The cash received from sales and location fees was $1,019,446.</p>
<p>The income from sales during the fiscal year, ending June 30, 1864, was $678,007,21, against $136,077,95 received during the preceding year. The aggregate number of acres surveyed during the year has been equal to the quantity disposed of; and there is open to settlement about 133,000,000 acres of surveyed land.</p>
<p>The great enterprise of connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific States by railways and telegraph lines has been entered upon with a vigor that gives assurance of success, notwithstanding the embarrassments arising from the prevailing high prices of materials and labor. The route of the main line of the road has been definitely located for one hundred miles westward from the initial point at Omaha City, Nebraska, and a preliminary location of the Pacific railroad of California has been made from Sacramento eastward to the great bend of the Truckee river in Nevada.</p>
<p>Numerous discoveries of gold, silver and cinnabar mines have been added to the many heretofore known and the country occupied by the Sierra Nevada and Rocky mountains, and the subordinate ranges, now teems with enterprising labor, which is richly remunerative. It is believed that the product of the mines of precious metals in that region has, during the year, reached, if not exceeded, one hundred millions in value.</p>
<p>It was recommended in my last annual message that our Indian system be remodelled. Congress, at its last session, acting upon the recommendation, did provide for reorganizing the system in California,<span class="ptr"><a name="8_146_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_146_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[29]</a></span> and it is believed that under the present organization the management of the Indians there will be attended with reasonable<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;147</span>
success. Much yet remains to be done to provide for the proper government of the Indians in other parts of the country to render it secure for the advancing settler, and to provide for the welfare of the Indian. The Secretary reiterates his recommendations, and to them the attention of Congress is invited.</p>
<p>The liberal provisions made by Congress for paying pensions to invalid soldiers and sailors of the republic, and to the widows, orphans, and dependent mothers of those who have fallen in battle, or died of disease contracted, or of wounds received in the service of their country, have been diligently administered. There have been added to the pension, rolls, during the year ending the 30th day of June last, the names of 16,770 invalid soldiers, and of 271 disabled seamen, making the present number of army invalid pensioners 22,767, and of navy invalid pensioners 712.</p>
<p>Of widows, orphans and mothers, 22 198 have been placed on the army pension rolls, and 248 on the navy rolls. The present number of army pensioners of this class is 25,433, and of navy pensioners 793. At the beginning of the year the number of revolutionary pensioners was 1,430; only twelve of them were soldiers, of whom seven have since died. The remainder are those who, under the law, receive pensions because of relationship to revolutionary soldiers. During the year ending the 30th of June, 1864, $4,504,616,92 have been paid to pensioners of all classes.</p>
<p>I cheerfully commend to your continued patronage the benevolent institutions of the District of Columbia which have hitherto been established or fostered by Congress, and respectfully refer, for information concerning them, and in relation to the Washington aqueduct, the Capitol and other matters of local interest, to the report of the Secretary.</p>
<p>The Agricultural Department,<span class="ptr"><a name="8_147_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_147_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[30]</a></span> under the supervision of its present energetic and faithful head, is rapidly commending itself to the great and vital interest it was created to advance. It is peculiarly<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;148</span>
the people's department, in which they feel more directly concerned than in any other. I commend it to the continued attention and fostering care of Congress.</p>
<p>The<span class="ptr"><a name="8_148_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_148_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[31]</a></span> war continues. Since the last annual message all the important lines and positions then occupied by our forces have been maintained, and our arms have steadily advanced;<span class="ptr"><a name="8_148_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_148_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[32]</a></span> thus liberating the regions left in rear, so that Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee and parts of other States have again produced reasonably fair crops.</p>
<p>The<span class="ptr"><a name="8_148_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_148_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[33]</a></span> most remarkable feature in the military operations of the year is General Sherman's attempted march of three hundred miles directly through the insurgent region. It tends to show a great increase of our relative strength that our General-in-Chief should feel able to confront and hold in check every active force of the enemy, and yet to detach a well-appointed large army to move on such an expedition.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_148_4"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_148_4;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[34]</a></span> The result not yet being known, conjecture in regard to it is not here indulged.</p>
<p>Important movements have also occurred during the year to the effect of moulding society for durability in the Union. Although short of complete success, it is much in the right direction, that twelve thousand citizens in each of the States of Arkansas and Louisiana have organized loyal State governments with free constitutions, and are earnestly struggling to maintain and administer them. The movements in the same direction, more extensive, though less definite in Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee, should not be overlooked. But Maryland presents<span class="ptr"><a name="8_148_5"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_148_5;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[35]</a></span> the example of complete success. Maryland is secure to Liberty and Union for all the future. The genius of rebellion will no more claim Maryland. Like<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;149</span>
another foul<span class="ptr"><a name="8_149_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_149_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[36]</a></span> spirit, being driven out, it may seek to tear her, but it will woo her no more.</p>
<p>At<span class="ptr"><a name="8_149_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_149_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[37]</a></span> the last session of Congress a proposed amendment of the Constitution abolishing slavery throughout the United States, passed the Senate, but failed for lack of the requisite two-thirds vote in the House of Representatives. Although the present is the same Congress, and nearly the same members, and without questioning the wisdom or patriotism of those who stood in opposition, I venture to recommend the reconsideration and passage of the measure at the present session. Of course the abstract question is not changed; but an intervening election shows, almost certainly, that the next Congress will pass the measure if this does not. Hence there is only a question of <span class="rend-i">time</span> as to when the proposed amendment will go to the States for their action. And as it is to so go, at all events, may we not agree that the sooner the better? It is not claimed that the election has imposed a duty on members to change their views or their votes, any further than, as an additional element to be considered, their judgment may be affected by it. It is the voice of the people now, for the first time, heard upon the question. In a great national crisis, like ours, unanimity of action among those seeking a common end is very desirable---almost indispensable. And yet no approach to such unanimity is attainable, unless some deference shall be paid to the will of the majority, simply because it is the will of the majority. In this case the common end is the maintenance of the Union; and, among the means to secure that end, such will, through the election, is most clearly declared in favor of such constitutional amendment.</p>
<p>The most reliable indication of public purpose in this country is derived through our popular elections. Judging by the recent canvass and its result, the purpose of the people, within the loyal States, to maintain the integrity of the Union, was never more firm, nor more nearly unanimous, than now. The extraordinary calmness and good order with which the millions of voters met and mingled at the polls, give strong assurance of this. Not only all those who supported the Union ticket, so called, but a great majority of the opposing party also, may be fairly claimed to entertain, and to be actuated by, the same purpose. It is an unanswerable argument to this effect, that no candidate for any office whatever, high or low, has ventured to seek votes on the avowal that<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;150</span>
he was for giving up the Union. There have been much impugning of motives, and much heated controversy as to the proper means and best mode of advancing the Union cause; but on the distinct issue of Union or no Union, the politicians have shown their instinctive knowledge that there is no diversity among the people. In affording the people the fair opportunity of showing, one to another and to the world, this firmness and unanimity of purpose, the election has been of vast value to the national cause.</p>
<p>The<span class="ptr"><a name="8_150_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_150_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[38]</a></span> election has exhibited another fact not less valuable to be known---the fact that we do not approach exhaustion in the most important branch of national resources---that of living men. While it is melancholy to reflect that the war has filled so many graves, and carried mourning to so many hearts, it is some relief to know that, compared with the surviving, the fallen have been so few. While corps, and divisions, and brigades, and regiments have formed, and fought, and dwindled, and gone out of existence, a great majority of the men who composed them are still living. The same is true of the naval service. The election returns prove this. So many voters could not else be found. The States regularly holding elections, both now and four years ago, to<span class="ptr"><a name="8_150_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_150_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[39]</a></span> wit, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin cast 3.982.011 votes now, against 3.870.222 cast then, showing an aggregate now of 3.982.011. To this is to be added 33.762 cast now in the new States of Kansas and Nevada, which States did not vote in 1860, thus swelling the aggregate to 4.015.773 and the net increase during the three years and a half of war to 145.551. A table is appended showing particulars. To<span class="ptr"><a name="8_150_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_150_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[40]</a></span> this again should be added the number of all soldiers in the field from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, Indiana, Illinois, and California, who, by the laws of those States, could not vote away from their<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;151</span>
homes, and which number cannot be less than 90.000. Nor yet is this all. The number in organized Territories is triple now what it was four years ago, while thousands, white and black, join us as the national arms press back the insurgent lines. So much is shown, affirmatively and negatively, by the election. It is not material to inquire <span class="rend-i">how</span> the increase has been produced, or to show that it would have been <span class="rend-i">greater</span> but for the war, which is probably true. The important fact remains demonstrated, that we have <span class="rend-i">more</span> men <span class="rend-i">now</span> than we had when the war <span class="rend-i">began</span>; that we are not exhausted, nor in process of exhaustion; that we are <span class="rend-i">gaining</span> strength, and may, if need be, maintain the contest indefinitely. This as to men. Material resources are now more complete and abundant than ever.</p>
<p>The national resources, then, are unexhausted, and, as we believe, inexhaustible. The public purpose to re-establish and maintain the national authority is unchanged, and, as we believe, unchangeable. The manner of continuing the effort remains to choose. On careful consideration of all the evidence accessible it seems to me that no attempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader could result in any good. He would accept nothing short of severance of the Union---precisely what we will not and cannot give. His declarations to this effect are explicit and oft-repeated. He does not attempt to deceive us. He affords us no excuse to deceive ourselves. He cannot voluntarily reaccept the Union; we cannot voluntarily yield it. Between him and us the issue is distinct, simple, and inflexible. It is an issue which can only be tried by war, and decided by victory. If we yield, we are beaten; if the Southern people fail him, he is beaten. Either way, it would be the victory and defeat following war. What is true, however, of him who heads the insurgent cause, is not<span class="ptr"><a name="8_151_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_151_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[41]</a></span> necessarily true of those who follow. Although he cannot reaccept the Union, they can. Some of them, we know, already desire peace and reunion. The number of such may increase. They can, at any moment, have peace simply by laying down their arms and submitting to<span class="ptr"><a name="8_151_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_151_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[42]</a></span> the national authority under the Constitution. After so much, the government could not, if it would, maintain war against them. The loyal people would not sustain or allow it. If questions should remain, we would adjust them by the peaceful means of legislation, conference, courts, and votes, operating only in constitutional and lawful channels. Some certain,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;152</span>
and other possible, questions are, and would be, beyond the Executive power to adjust; as, for instance, the admission of members into Congress, and whatever might require the appropriation of money. The Executive power itself would be greatly diminished by the cessation of actual war. Pardons and remissions of forfeitures, however, would still be within Executive control. In what spirit and temper this control would be exercised can be fairly judged of by the past.</p>
<p>A year ago general pardon and amnesty, upon specified terms, were offered to all, except certain designated classes; and, it was, at the same time, made known that the excepted classes were still within contemplation of special clemency. During the year many availed themselves of the general provision, and many more would, only that the signs of bad faith in some led to such precautionary measures as rendered the practical process less easy and certain. During the same time also special pardons have been granted to individuals of the excepted classes, and no voluntary application has been denied. Thus, practically, the door has been, for a full year, open to all, except such as were not in condition to make free choice---that is, such as were in custody or under constraint. It is still so open to all. But the time may come---probably will come---when public duty shall demand that it be closed; and that, in lieu, more rigorous measures than heretofore shall be adopted.</p>
<p>In<span class="ptr"><a name="8_152_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_152_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[43]</a></span> presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the national authority on the part of the insurgents, as the only indispensable condition to ending the war on the part of the government, I retract nothing heretofore said as to slavery. I repeat the declaration made a year ago, that ``while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor shall I return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation, or by any of the Acts of Congress.'' If<span class="ptr"><a name="8_152_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_152_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[44]</a></span> the people should, by whatever mode or means, make it an Executive duty to re-enslave such persons, another, and not I, must be their instrument to perform it.</p>
<p>In stating a single condition of peace, I mean simply to say that the war will cease on the part of the government, whenever it shall have ceased on the part of those who began it.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; AES, owned by Max Thorek, Chicago, Illinois. Lincoln's endorsements are written on a letter of General Benjamin F. Butler to C. C. Callam of Baltimore, September 15, 1864:</p>
<p>``I suppose yours is the fiftieth communication I have received about [Abraham] Samuels, some asking that he be tried, and some asking one thing, and some another; and this is the last communication I shall answer about Samuels from any source, except under orders from the President.</p>
<p>``Samuels' case is this: He left Richmond with a list of Medical supplies in his pocket under an agreement to procure those supplies for the Rebel Medical Department.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;163</span>``He was detected, arrested, examined, and confined, and he will be confined during the War, so far as any act of mine can aid that desirable result.''</p>
<p>Lincoln's first undated endorsement was presumably written between September 15 and December 10, probably closer to the later date. On January 8, 1865, General Butler wrote Lincoln:</p>
<p>``Abraham Samuels was arrested in January, 1864, when endeavoring to make his way through my lines across the Potomac. Upon examination he confessed that the paragraph in the Richmond <span class="rend-i">Examiner</span>, December 28th, 1863, herewith furnished, was furnished to that paper by himself in answer to a paragraph in a former issue saying . . . that Samuels had endeavored to escape to the Yankees. He farther confessed that when he left Richmond he had the list of medical stores which is mentioned in the <span class="rend-i">Examiner</span>, which he recovered from the medical purveyor of the Confederate Army, and that he had engaged to run the blockade and bring back the stores: that he had destroyed this paper. From all the surroundings and his story I was satisfied that he was in the interest of the Confederates, and I caused him to be held as a dangerous and disloyal person, and confiscated the money he had with him . . . and placed it to the credit of the United States where it remains.</p>
<p>``A great number of applications were made for his release, to all of which I would not listen until after we had so constructed our lines about Richmond that I was satisfied that Samuels' vocation as blockade runner was gone, and then upon an intimation from the President I released him, not because of his innocence . . . but because he was no longer dangerous. . . .''

<p>I think it is probable that you are laboring under some misapprehension as to the purpose, or rather the motive of the government on two points---<span class="rend-i">Cotton</span>, and the new <span class="rend-i">Louisiana State</span> Government. It is conceded that the military operations are the <span class="rend-i">first</span> in importance; and as to what is indispensable to these operations, the Department Commander must be judge and master. But the other matters mentioned, I suppose to be of public importance also; and what I have attempted in regard to them, is not merely a concession to private interest and pecuniary greed.</p>
<p>As to cotton. By the external blockade, the price is made certainly six times as great as it was. And yet the enemy gets through at least one sixth part as much in a given period, say a year, as if there were no blockade, and receives as much for it, as he would for a full crop in time of peace. The effect in substance is, that we give him six ordinary crops, without the trouble of producing any but the first; and at the same time leave his fields and his laborers free to produce provisions. You know how this keeps up his armies at<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;164</span>
home, and procures supplies from abroad. For other reasons we cannot give up the blockade, and hence it becomes immensely important to us to get the cotton away from him. Better give him <span class="rend-i">guns</span> for it, than let him, as now, get both guns and ammunition for it. But even this only presents part of the public interest to get out cotton. Our finances are greatly involved in the matter. The way cotton goes now carries so much gold out of the country as to leave us paper currency only, and that so far depreciated, as that for every hard dollar's worth of supplies we obtain, we contract to pay two and a half hard dollars hereafter. This is much to be regretted; and while I believe we can live through it at all events, it demands an earnest effort on the part of all to correct it. And if pecuniary greed can be made to aid us in such effort, let us be thankful that so much good can be got out of pecuniary greed.</p>
<p>As to the new State Government of Louisiana. Most certainly there is no worthy object in getting up a piece of machinery merely to pay salaries, and give political consideration to certain men. But it is a worthy object to again get Louisiana into proper practical relations with the nation; and we can never finish this, if we never begin it. Much good work is already done, and surely nothing can be gained by throwing it away.</p>
<p>I do not wish either cotton or the new State Government to take precedence of the military, while the necessity for the military remains; but there is a strong public reason for treating each with so much favor as may not be substantially detrimental to the military.</p>
<p>Allow me a word of explanation in regard to the telegram which you kindly forwarded to Admiral Faragut for me.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_164_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_164_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> That telegram was prompted by a piece of secret information inducing me to suspect that the use of a forged paper might be attempted on the Admiral, in order to base a claim that we had raised our own blockade.</p>
<p>I am happy in the hope that you are almost well of your late and severe wound Yours very truly,</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy, DLC-RTL. The copy is on Executive Mansion stationery. On December 2, apropos of Lincoln's communication to Hurlbut of November 14, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>, General Canby had written Lincoln:</p>
<p>``Major General Hurlbut has shown me your communication of the 14th inst., in which that officer and myself are charged with bitter animosity to the new State Government of Louisiana.</p>
<p>``I have had very little official connection with the convention, and none at all with the State Government, or the State Legislature. Matters connected with these bodies, being under the supervision of the Department Commander, do not reach me, except by way of appeal, and my own duties have been sufficiently engrossing, to prevent any disposition to interfere, unless the subject was submitted to me for decision. Of the three instances cited in evidence of this bitter<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;165</span>
animosity, the first is the only one of which I have any knowledge, either official or personal. The others I had never heard of until I read your letter. In the case of Mr. [Thomas P.] May I <span class="rend-i">did</span> interfere upon an appeal, and for the reason simply, that the power claimed by the Convention to punish for contempt not committed in its presence, could not be admitted without establishing, in the military circumstances of the community, a very dangerous precedent. <span class="rend-i">That</span> opinion I still entertain. I saw then, and I see now, no reason why the usual limit of legislative power, and which the convention had, a few days previous, (Act 30, of the Convention,) defined for the Legislature, and, by implication, for itself, should have been transcended. There was no necessity for it, for the convention was under military protection, and that protection would have been given to it under any circumstances, and to any extent.</p>
<p>``Of the details of the insult offered to the convention in the release of Mr. May, I know nothing. My decision was communicated to General Banks, and the orders were given by him; but I <span class="rend-i">do</span> know, that, while we differed on some points, we concurred in the opinion, that the convention had no legitimate power to arrest, or try, or punish any one, for a contempt, not committed in its presence.</p>
<p>``I think it only necessary to add to this, that it has been, and is my purpose, not only as a question of duty, but of feeling, to give whatever support and aid I can, to the State Government; but it is proper that your Excellency should be advised, that matters that will, ultimately, come under the control of the State Government, are now so complicated with questions of military administration, that, in the changes to be made, differences of opinion may arise, which should not subject officers of the army to the imputation of opposition or animosity. . . .''

<p>My Dear Sir---I have the honor to acknowledge the reception of your kind invitation to be present at the annual festival of the New England Society to commemorate the landing of the Pilgrims, on Thursday, the 22d of this month.</p>
<p>My duties will not allow me to avail myself of your kindness. I cannot but congratulate you and the country, however, upon the spectacle of devoted unanimity presented by the people at home, the citizens that form our marching columns, and the citizens that fill our squadrons on the sea---all animated by the same determination to complete and perpetuate the work our fathers began and transmitted.</p>
<p>The work of the Plymouth emigrants was the glory of their age. While we reverence their memory, let us not forget how vastly greater is our opportunity. I am very truly, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>Joseph H. Choate, Esq. A. LINCOLN.</p>

<p>Whereas, by the act approved July 4, 1864, entitled ``An Act further to regulate and provide for the enrolling and calling out the national forces, and for other purposes,'' it is provided that the President of the United States may, ``at his discretion, at any time hereafter, call for any number of men, as volunteers, for the respective terms of one, two, and three years, for military service,'' and ``that in case the quota, or any part thereof, of any town, township, ward of a city, precinct, or election district, or of any county not so sub-divided, shall not be filled within the space of fifty days after such call, then the President shall immediately order a draft for one year, to fill such quota, or any part thereof, which may be unfilled:''</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;172</span>And whereas by the credits allowed in accordance with the act of Congress on the call for five hundred thousand men made July 18th. 1864, the number of men to be obtained under that call was reduced to two hundred and eighty thousand; and whereas the operations of the enemy in certain States have rendered it impracticable to procure from them their full quotas of troops under said call; and whereas, from the foregoing causes, but two hundred and forty thousand men have been put into the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps under the said call of July 18, 1864, leaving a deficiency on that call of two hundred and sixty thousand: (260,000):</p>
<p>Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America, in order to supply the aforesaid deficiency, and to provide for casualties in the military and naval service of the United States, do issue this my call for three hundred thousand (300,000) volunteers to serve for one, two, or three years. The quotas of the States, districts, and sub-districts under this call will be assigned by the War Department through the Bureau of the Provost Marshal General of the United States, and, ``in case the quota or any part thereof of any town, township, ward of a city, precinct or election district, or of any county not so sub-divided, shall not be filled'' before the fifteenth day of February, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, then a draft shall be made to fill such quota, or any part thereof, under this call, which may be unfilled on said fifteenth day of February 1865.</p>
<p>In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>James R. Mallory, citizen of Tennessee, was sentenced to death by hanging, on charges of murder and violation of the laws and customs of war.

Jacob wrote Lincoln from Richmond, Virginia: ``On the night of the 11th of November last, I was arrested by the order of . . . General Burbridge at my country home. . . . I was carried to Lexington, and kept at General McLeans head quarters some two hours. I courted [?] and confidently expected to have had an interview with General Burbridge. I was by his orders carried under strict guard, and expelled through the Federal lines under the penalty of death if I returned<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;183</span></p>
<p>during the war. I was thus forced by necessity into the Confederate lines, to accept the hospitality and protection of a people that I had fought against. . . . A poor return for wounds received, and hard service rendered to ones country. Even a thief has the boon of being condemned before he is punished. . . . It is difficult to defend ones self, when no charges are preferred. I have not even a conjecture to go on except a telegram that I had cut out of the Cincinnatti Commercial. Which is as follows, `The Post's Washington letter says the arrest of Lieutenant Governor Jacob will lead to important disclosures. There are rumors of a wide spread conspiracy existing in that State, not to take it over to a rebel confederacy, but to inaugurate a second revolution, the object of which is to make Kentucky independent of the General Government.' If my arrest would lead to important disclosures would not common sense have suggested that I should have been detained and examined. If there was a wide spread conspiracy I knew not of it, nor do I believe for one moment there was any such. I never was connected with a conspiracy. . . . True Mr. President I was opposed to your re-election, and it is the only charge that can with truth be brought against me. . . . Three days after the election I was seized. I find this in the Richmond Sentinel of the first of December taken from the Louisville Journal. [`]We are happy to announce that President Lincoln has consented to the release of Lieutenant Governor Jacob and Col. Frank Wolford. We sincerely hope that this may be the commencement of a new policy. . . .' Now Sir, I wish to find out whether this is true or not, and if so whether you will not order that I be passed through the lines to return to my duties as Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky. . . . As I have committed no crime, I ask not for pardon, but merely simple justice. . . .''</p>
<p>Captain J. Bates Dickson, assistant adjutant general in command in the absence of General Stephen G. Burbridge, answered Lincoln's telegram on December 28, 1864: ``So far as I am informed, . . . Jacob's offense was making treasonable and seditious speeches, calculated and intended to weaken the power of the Government. . . . His arrest was advised by Doctor [Robert J.] Breckinridge and other prominent loyal men of Kentucky. General Burbridge will address you fully on the subject upon his return. I have had no communication with him since the 14th instant, and do not know his present location'' (OR, I, XLV, II, 402).</p>

<p>``The fact stated in the enclosed note may seem to answer inquiries as to the object of my visit, which if allowed by you I would not communicate fully to any one but yourself. The main purpose I have in seeing you is to explain the views I entertain in reference to the state of the affairs of our country &amp; to submit to your consideration ideas which in my opinion you may turn to good &amp; possibly bring to practical results that may not only repair all the ruin the war has brought upon the Nation but contribute to . . . the welfare of other nations that have suffered from it.</p>

<p>You remember that upon consultation with me you ordered two men arrested by Gen. Wallace to be discharged, and the third, a Mr. Waters, to be held for trial.

<p>To the House of Representatives of the United States.</p>
<p>I herewith return to your honorable body, in which it originated, a ``Joint Resolution to correct certain clerical errors in the Internal Revenue Act'' without my approval.</p>
<p>My reason for so doing is, that I am informed that this Joint Resolution was prepared during the last moments of the last session of Congress, for the purpose of correcting certain errors of reference in the Internal Revenue Act, which were discovered on an examination of an official copy procured from the State Department, a few hours only before the adjournment. It passed the House and went to the Senate, where a vote was taken upon it, but by some accident it was not presented to the President of the Senate for his Signature.</p>
<p>Since the adjournment of the last session of Congress, other errors of a kind similar to those, which this resolution was designed to correct, have been discovered in the law, and it is now thought most expedient to include all the necessary corrections in one Act or Resolution.</p>
<p>The attention of the proper Committee of the House, has I am informed, been already directed to the preparation of a bill for this purpose. ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; LS (copy?), DLC-RTL. Filed with this letter is a newspaper clipping of General Dana's order to Lieutenant Colonel J. P. Harper, permit officer at Memphis, Tennessee, December 26, 1864:</p>
<p>``The very great latitude allowed to persons in procuring `applications' from the Purchasing Agent of the Treasury Department, and the facility with which they are issued, appears to render it imperative, on the part of the military authorities, that all applicants be required to set aside doubts as to their actually and `bona fide' <span class="rend-i">owning or controlling</span> the products named in their application; and that they are not mere speculators and adventurers, who have procured papers merely to furnish them the opportunity of going around to hunt up products for purchase; nor persons who have gotten them merely for the object of passing through the lines.</p>
<p>``Of the class of applicants who <span class="rend-i">own</span> products there may be two descriptions, viz: those who have raised them, and those who have purchased them.</p>
<p>``Of the first division of this class, prior to issuing a safe conduct or permit, you will require an affidavit of themselves, and one other loyal, disinterested respectable person, showing when and where the products were raised, the quantity, where they are at the time of making the affidavit, and in whose possession, in case they have been moved from the place where they were raised, the time of removal, etc.</p>
<p>``Of the second division of this class, you will require affidavit as above, of who was the last preceding owner---the time and place of purchase, the price paid, or to be paid, and the description of money or property in which payment was made, or is to be made, the place where the products were when purchased, the quantity, and the place where they are at the time of making the affidavit, and in whose possession.</p>
<p>``Of the persons <span class="rend-i">controlling</span> products you will require a similar affidavit, showing precisely where the products were raised or were stored at the time they obtained <span class="rend-i">control</span> of them; the quantity and to whom belonging; the means and circumstances by which they obtained control; the place where they are at the time of making affidavit and in whose possession.</p>
<p>``In all instances where persons are unable to make the above proofs, or when you are satisfied of any fraudulent intent, you are forbidden to issue safe guard or permit, and you will note that fact on the application.</p>
<p>``You will keep exact record of all rejected applications.''</p>
<p>On January 17, General Dana replied to Lincoln's letter:</p>
<p>``I have the honor to reply to the letter of your Excellency dated the 6th instant, and, whilst I express my unfeigned regret . . .that any misconception of mine, arising from a misunderstanding of the policy of the government, under the requirements of orders from my immediate superior, should subject me to your Excellency's disapprobation, I have no hesitancy in believing that I shall henceforth, in the matter, have no fear of censure, as I believe I now fully understand your wishes. . . .</p>
<p>``It was hardly to be expected that, in the inauguration of a system so new to us and so entirely contrary to our previous instructions, that Commanders would not find many difficulties to encounter; but I expected to obviate these in a very short time. When my first safeguards were issued . . .certain persons who held them were arrested by Naval Commanders who desired to know by what proofs I was satisfied they `owned or controlled' the products and stated that they knew the contrary. Thereupon I issued the letter of instructions and supposed, so far from thwarting and defeating the objects of the government, that I was carrying them out in good faith. . . .On the 5th of January Genl. Canby . . .disapproved my action . . .and I immediately discontinued the requirement. . . .</p>
<p>``I am persuaded that however much many persons, who had not fully informed themselves at the inauguration of a new set of regulations, were disposed to complain and make trouble, they are now convinced that they were<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;203</span>
more impatient than injured, and that the people of this Department [of the Mississippi] are, at present, well satisfied that the Executive Order and Treasury Regulations of Sept 24 are being carried out with the least possible obstruction. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>

Madam Washington, Jany. 9. 1865.</div>
<p>It was with regret I learned that your brother, whom I had ordered to be discharged on taking the oath, under the impression that he was a <span class="rend-i">private</span>, is a <span class="rend-i">captain</span>. By an understanding the Commissary of prisoners detains such cases until a further hearing from me. I now distinctly say that if your Father shall come within our lines and take the oath of Dec. 8. 1863, I will give him a full pardon, and will, at the same time, discharge your brother on his taking the oath, notwithstanding he is a captain. Respectfully</p>
<p>A. LINCOLN.</p>

On the back of the letter appear two endorsements, the first certifying that Charles James Faulkner took the oath of allegiance on May 30, 1865, and the second, by James Speed, ordering: ``Pardon &amp; file this paper.'' On the bottom of the letter, however, appears the following unsigned note in pencil: ``My Father <span class="rend-i">never</span> took the oath of allegiance after the War and did not return until <span class="rend-i">after</span> the surrender.'' It would appear that Lincoln's letter was written to Mary Boyd Faulkner, who was the wife of the Charles James Faulkner, Sr. (see note to Lincoln's order to Martindale, July 17, 1864, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>). But this seems improbable, since her father was not living at the time and no brother has been identified who would fit the description in Lincoln's letter. Another possibility is that Lincoln's letter was intended for ``Miss'' rather than ``Mrs.'' Faulkner. In this case the father would be Charles James Faulkner, Sr., and the brother would be Captain Elisha Boyd Faulkner, captured in June, 1864, and confined on Johnson's Island at the time of Lincoln's letter. Which one of Charles James Faulkner's six daughters may have received Lincoln's letter has not been ascertained.</p>

My dear Sir: Washington, January 9, 1865.</div>
<p>The paper, relating to Louisiana, submitted to the Judiciary Committee of the Senate, by Gen. Banks, is herewith returned.

All the statements which lie within the range of my knowledge are strictly true; and I think<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;207</span>
of nothing material which has been omitted. Even before Gen. Banks went to Louisiana I was anxious for the loyal people there to move for re-organization and restoration of proper practical relations with the Union; and when he, at last, expressed his decided conviction that the thing was practicable, I directed him to give his official co-operation to effect it. On the subject, I have sent and received many letters to and from Gen. Banks and many other persons. These letters, as you remember, were shown to you yesterday, as they will be again, if you desire.</p>
<p>If I shall neither take sides nor argue, will it be out of place for me to make what I think is the true statement of your question as to the proposed Louisiana Senators?</p>

Lincoln's endorsement appears on a letter of Vital Jarrot to Senator Lyman Trumbull, Philadelphia, January 16, 1865: ``After reaching this place transacting some business here on my way to Washington City, I received a telegram, from my son in law, calling me back home immediately. You will therefore pardon me for calling upon you to represent me with the Executive. To be short---at the solicitations of the traders along the Platte I have consented to apply to Mr Lincoln for the Indian Agency of the Sious on the Platts. I am informed that said agency is now vacant and I am vain enough to concur, with the Indian traders I have seen, in believing that I could do much with the Indians in bringing them back to peaceful relations with us. To give what, I am informed, was the cause of their<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;226</span></p>
<p>present hostility would require more space than an ordinary letter. I shall therefor neither trouble you with the details of the origin, progress and present condition of the troubles with those Indians. Should you however please apply and procure me the appointment, it will be time for me then to lay all the information I have received on the subject, before the proper department. This is my only application I have ever made for executive favor of any kind and I do not think that I am expecting too much, to believe that the President on your recommendation will appoint me.''</p>
<p>Vital Jarrot of St. Clair County, Illinois, who had followed his father Nicholas Jarrot in the Indian trade, had been known to Lincoln from the period of the Black Hawk War and had served with Lincoln in the Illinois House of Representatives in 1838-1839. He was nominated agent of the Upper Platte Agency on February 17 and confirmed by the Senate on March 3, 1865.</p>

Major General Reynolds. Jan. 20. 1865</div>
<p>It would appear by the accompanying papers that Mrs. Mary E. Morton is the owner, independently of her husband, of a certain building, premises and furniture, which she, with her children, has been occupying and using peaceably during the war, until recently, when the Provost-Marshal, has, in the name of the U.S. government, seized the whole of said property, and ejected her from it. It also appears by her statement to me, that her husband went off in the rebellion at the beginning, wherein he still remains.</p>
<p>It would seem that this seizure has not been made for any Military object, as for a place of storage, a hospital, or the like, because this would not have required the seizure of the furniture, and especially not the return of furniture previously taken away.</p>
<p>The seizure must have been on some claim [of] <span class="rend-i">confiscation</span>, a matter of which the courts, and <span class="rend-i">not</span> the Provost-Marshals, or other military officers are to judge. In this very case, would probably be the questions ``Is either the husband or wife a traitor?'' ``Does the property belong to the husband or to the wife?'' ``Is the property of the wife confiscable for the treason of the husband?'' and other similar questions, all which it is ridiculous for a Provost-Marshal to assume to decide.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;229</span>The true rule for the Military is to seize such property as is needed for Military uses and reasons, and let the rest alone. Cotton and other staple articles of commerce are seizable for military reasons. Dwelling-houses &amp; furniture are seldom so. If Mrs. Morton is playing traitor, to the extent of practical injury, seize her, but leave her house to the courts. Please revise and adjust this case upon these principles. Yours &amp;c A.

<p>The draft matter complained of by Gov.

The practical difficulty may be illustrated by the following supposed case. The towns of A &amp; B---before any enlisted, had each 100 men. On the late call A gave sixty six <span class="rend-i">one</span> year men, leaving only 34 at home, while B. gave 33 three-years men, leaving 67 at home. On the pending call each owes 100 men, subject to its credit. But while A gets credit for 66---it owes 34---taking the last man in it; while B gets credit for 99---owes one, and has sixty-six left quietly at home. This ugly conjuncture occurs in some sort accidentally, some towns putting in one years men and others three years men, while attaching no consequence to the difference, but which now burthens the one class absolutely beyond their immediate power to bear. While the above is only a supposed case, I am told there are realities that are even stranger---when there are not men enough in the town to answer it's quota.

They were formerly employed as detectives on the Metropolitan Police force, and subsequently Hogan was a special detective of the Treasury Department. While so acting, a robbery was committed, in February last. The trunk of Major [Benjamin] Malone, a Paymaster in the Army, was robbed of nearly $2,000. Some time after, Hogan and Dugan were arrested by Superintendent Wood, on charge of being concerned in the robbery, and they have ever since been held in custody.</p>

I wish you to read, if you have not already done so, the glowing, and eloquent, and truthful words which he then spoke of the women of America. Truly, the services they have rendered to the defenders of our country in this perilous time, and are yet rendering, can never be estimated as they ought to be. For your kind wishes to me, personally, I beg leave to render you, likewise, my sincerest thanks. I assure you they are reciprocated. And now, gentlemen and ladies, may God bless you all.</p>

The order of exercises listed item 7, ``SINGING---`YOUR MISSION'---By Mr. PHILIP PHILLIPS, of Cincinnati.'' An endorsement appears on the bottom of the program: ``This is the <span class="rend-i">original</span> Programme used by <span class="rend-i">President Lincoln</span> in the Hall of the House of Representatives Washington on the occasion of the third anniversary of the U.S. Christian Commission January 29th. 1865 when <span class="rend-i">Mr. Philip Phillip</span> sang `Your Mission' at the close of the Hymn the President<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;246</span></p>
<p>wrote on the other side with his own hand a request that it [be] repeated which was done between 11 &amp; 12 O'clock P.M. GEO. H. STUART.''</p>
<p>George H. Stuart, chairman of the Commission, conducted the meeting. On January 30, Phillips wrote Lincoln:</p>
<p>``I learn through Mr Geo H Stuart . . . that you made the request to him <span class="rend-i">in writing</span> for me to repeat my little song---`<span class="rend-i">Your Mission</span>' at our Aniversary last sunday night. The honor created in me a strong desire to have the request in writing as you gave it to him. But Mr S wanted it himself, and said I could apply to you for another and you to send it to me by mail.</p>
<p>``This little favor in <span class="rend-i">your own</span> hand writing I should appreciate nearly as highly as having <span class="rend-i">the honor</span> of singing <span class="rend-i">many</span> songs---together with <span class="rend-i">Two</span> (2) hearty votes for <span class="rend-i">you</span> during the last five years. . . .</p>
<p>``I will send to you my last little singing Book for your little Boy containing the Song `<span class="rend-i">Your Mission'</span>'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>No reply to Phillips' letter has been found. The text of ``Your Mission'' may be found in the <span class="rend-i">Annals of the Christian Commission</span>, pp. 256-57.</p>

Loveaire, who desires to make a brief statement respecting his son, rendered me more service, in raising volunteers, than any other citizen of Philadelphia. He is the esteemed Lieutenant of Police in the 15th. Ward. . . .'' The son was probably Private John S.

<p>The President said he supposed the passage through Congress of the Constitutional amendment for the abolishment of Slavery throughout the United States, was the occasion to which he was indebted for the honor of this call. [Applause.] The occasion was one of congratulation to the country and to the whole world. But there is a task yet before us---to go forward and consummate by the votes of the States that which Congress so nobly began yesterday. [Applause and cries---``They will do it,'' &amp;c.] He had the honor to inform those present that Illinois had already to-day done the work.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_254_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_254_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> [Applause.] Maryland was about half through; but he felt proud that Illinois was a little ahead. He thought this measure was a very fitting if not an indispensable adjunct to the winding up of the great difficulty. He wished the reunion of all the States perfected and so effected as to remove all causes of disturbance in the future; and to attain this end it was necessary that the original disturbing cause should, if possible, be rooted out. He thought all would bear him witness that he had never shrunk from doing all that he could to eradicate Slavery by issuing an emancipation proclamation. [Applause.] But that proclamation falls far short of what the amendment will be when fully consummated. A question might be raised whether the proclamation was legally valid. It might be added that it only aided those who came into our lines and that it was inoperative as to those who did not give themselves up, or that it would have no effect upon the children of the slaves born hereafter. In fact it would be urged that it did not meet the evil. But this amendment is a King's cure for all the evils. [Applause.] It winds the whole thing up. He would repeat that it was the fitting if not indispensable adjunct to the consummation of the great game we are playing. He could not but congratulate all present,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;255</span>
himself, the country and the whole world upon this great moral victory.</p>

Filling the army cannot be delayed by calls on the office of the Provost Marshal that will require months to fill and which can serve no other purpose than delay.''</p>

<p>``Respectfully referred to the Secretary of War.</p>
<p>``The principles and figures upon which the quotas of the city of New York were assigned on the 24th ultimo, and which designate the number of men required, have been already examined by a committee on the part of the Board of Supervisors of New York, who approved of the same and reported that the revised quotas of January are correct, except that they allege an excessive enrollment.

<p>Now therefore I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do proclaim, declare, and make known, that on the conditions therein stated, the power conferred on the Executive in and by said Joint Resolution, will be fully exercised; that war will cease, and armies be reduced to a basis of peace; that all political offences will be pardoned; that all property, except slaves, liable to confiscation or forfeiture, will be released therefrom, except in cases of intervening interests of third parties; and that liberality will be recommended to congress upon all points not lying within executive control.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; OR, III, IV, 1142. Following receipt of Lincoln's endorsement of February 4, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>, James B. Fry wrote the Committee of the Board of Supervisors of New York on February 5 that having laid their request before the president and having ``received their instructions to this effect, I beg you will excuse me from giving time to an investigation into the December assignment.'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>., p. 1128).</p>
<p>To this letter the committee replied on the same date that they thought the figures necessary, ``in order to show the occasion of the increase of the quotas assigned in January,'' but that they ``desire now to be allowed to copy from the records the enrollment of the remaining Congressional districts of the loyal States. . . .'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>., pp. 1129-30).</p>
<p>Fry replied on the same day, quoting Lincoln's and Stanton's endorsement on the committee's letter of February 4, <span class="rend-i">supra</span> (<span class="rend-i">ibid</span>., 1132-33). On February 6, the committee interviewed the president and submitted their case in writing:</p>
<p>``<span class="rend-i">To His Excellency the President of the United States</span>:</p>
<p>``Under your call of Dec. 19, 1864, for 300,000 men, there was assigned to the County of New-York, on the 23d of December, a quota of 4,423 men.</p>
<p>``On the 24th of January, 1865, our quota was increased to 21,019 men.</p>
<p>``We ask:</p>
<p>``1. Inasmuch as the increase in our quota is due in great part to a reassignment of quotas after the correction of the enrollment in other districts, we think it but fair that our quota should be reassigned after the correction of our enrollment. We ask, therefore, that upon the completion of the correction of our enrollment, which will be in about twenty days, our quota be reassigned.</p>
<p>``2. In case our County shall keep her Provost-Marshals reasonably busy mustering in recruits, that the Provost Marshals be not withdrawn from that duty to enforce the draft.</p>
<p>``3. To satisfy our constituents as to the justice of this increase of our quota, we ask leave to copy the figures on which the quotas of December and January are based. As the quota of each district depends on the figures for every other district, we shall be obliged to copy the figures of all the districts of the loyal States. This we will do at any hour of day or night which may be least inconvenient to the War Department, and we will do it in less than two hours.'' (New York <span class="rend-i">Tribune</span>, February 9, 1865. The original document has not been found and does not appear in the <span class="rend-i">Official Records</span>.)</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;263</span>The committee's account of Lincoln's response is as follows:</p>
<p>``Although your Committee received no positive assurance from the President to the two first points presented to him, they were led to believe that His Excellency saw their force and justice.</p>
<p>``In regard to the third point, however, in which our correspondence with the Provost-Marshal General had been so unsatisfactory, he remarked that it had been represented to him that we desired these figures for the purpose of showing that the Government was wrong. Your Committee assured him, however, that their only object was to be put in possession of the data on which they might satisfy themselves and their constituents that the quota assigned them was just.'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>.)</p>
<p>During the interview, Lincoln gave the committee the letter to Fry (as above). Upon receiving Lincoln's letter, Fry went to the president and obtained the endorsement excusing him at Lincoln's request. Fry addressed two further letters to the committee on February 6, refusing their request and dismissing the matter with the statement, ``I have no further time at my disposal to devote to this subject.'' (OR, III, IV, 1144).</p>
<p>Much disgruntled, the committee returned to New York and published their report, including the correspondence exchanged with Provost Marshal Fry (New York <span class="rend-i">Tribune</span>, February 9, 1865).</p>

This letter is supplied with the date ``February [1?], 1865, in Nicolay and Hay (X, 354), but must have been written after February 7, the date on which Grant telegraphed to Stanton: ``A. M. Laws is here with a steamer partially loaded with sugar and coffee, and a permit from the Treasury Department to go through into Virginia and North Carolina, and to bring out 10,000 bales of cotton. I have positively refused to adopt this mode of feeding the Southern army unless it is the direct order of the President. It is a humiliating fact that speculators have represented the location of cotton at different points in the South, and obtained permits to bring it out, covering more than the entire amount of the staple in all the cotton-growing States. . . .'' (OR, I, XLVI, II, 445).</p>
<p>Stanton replied on the same day: ``The President directs that you will regard<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;268</span>
all trade permits, licenses, or privileges of every kind, by whomsoever signed . . . as subject to your authority and approval as commander of the U.S. forces in the field, and such permits as you deem prejudicial to the military service by feeding or supporting the rebel armies . . . you may disregard and annul, and if necessary to the public safety seize the property of the traders. In short, the President orders that you `as being responsible for military results, must be allowed to be judge and master on the subject of trade with the enemy.'

<div class="opener">His Excellency Executive Mansion,<br>
Gov. Smith Washington, Feb'y. 8th, 1865.</div>
<p>Complaint is made to me by Vermont that the assignment of her quota for the draft on the pending call is intrinsically unjust, and also in bad faith of the government's promise to fairly allow credits for men previously furnished. To illustrate a supposed case is stated as follows.</p>
<p>Vermont and New Hampshire must between them furnish 6000<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;272</span>
men on the pending call,<span class="ptr"><a name="8_272_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_272_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> and being equals each must furnish as many as the other in the long run. But the Government finds that on former calls, Vermont furnished a surplus of 500, and New Hampshire a surplus of 1500. These two surpluses making 2000 an[d] added to the 6000, making 8000 to be furnished by the two states or 4000 each less by fair credits. Then subtract Vermont's surplus of 500 from her 4000, leaves 3500 as her quota on the pending call; and likewise subtract New Hampshire's surplus of 1500 from her 4000 leaves 2500 as her quota on the pending call. These 3500 &amp; 2500 make precisely the 6000 which the supposed case requires from the two states; and it is just---equal---for Vermont to furnish 1000 more <span class="rend-i">now</span> than New Hampshire, <span class="rend-i">because</span> New Hampshire has <span class="rend-i">heretofore</span> furnished a 1000 more than Vermont which equalizes the burthens of the two in the long run. And this result so far from being bad faith to Vermont is indispensable to keeping good faith with New Hampshire. By no other result can the 6000 men be obtained from the two states and at the same time deal justly and keep faith with both; and we do but confuse ourselves in questioning the process by which the right result is reached. The supposed case is perfect as an illustration.</p>
<p>The pending call is <span class="rend-i">not</span> for 300,000 men subject to fair credits, but is for 300,000 remaining after all fair credits have been deducted; and it is impossible to concede what Vermont asks, without coming out short of the 300,000 men, or making other localities pay for the partiality shown her.</p>
<p>This upon the case stated---if there be different reasons for making an allowance to Vermont let them be presented and considered. Yours truly</p>

According to Eaton's account, the dispute in congress over shifting the Freedmen's Bureau from the War Department to the Treasury prompted him to consult the president: ``I asked Mr. Lincoln if he would give me a word over his own signature to strengthen me against the difficulties I felt might still be encountered. To this he agreed . . . and asked me to write out an order which I deemed would be most useful for my purposes. I wrote the following informal order, summarizing the verbal instructions he had already given me. . . .'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>., p. 231).</p>

<p>To the Honorable, the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>In response to your resolution of the 8th. Inst. requesting information in relation to a conference recently held in Hampton Roads</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;275</span>I have the honor to state that on the day of the date I gave Francis P. Blair <span class="rend-i">sent</span> a card written on as follows, towit:<span class="ptr"><a name="8_275_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_275_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>Allow the bearer, F. P. Blair, Senr. to pass our lines, go South and return</p>
<p>Dec. 28. 1864 A. LINCOLN</p>
<p>That at the time I was informed that Mr. Blair sought the card as a means of getting to Richmond, Va. but he was given no authority to speak or act for the government; nor was I informed of any thing he would say or do on his own account, or otherwise. Afterwards Mr. Blair told me that he had been to Richmond, and had seen Mr. Jefferson Davis; and he Mr. B. at the same time left with me a manuscript letter, as follows, towit:<span class="ptr"><a name="8_275_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_275_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span></p>
<p>F. P. Blair Esqr. Richmond Va</p>
<p>Sir: 12 Jany 65</p>
<p>I have deemed it proper and probably desirable to you to give you in this form the substance of remarks made by me to be repeated by you to Presdt. Lincoln &amp;c &amp;c</p>
<p>I have no disposition to find obstacles in forms, and am willing now as heretofore to enter into negociations for the restoration of Peace; am ready to send a commission whenever I have reason to suppose it will be received, or to receive a commission if the U.S. Govt. shall choose to send one. That notwithstanding the rejection of our former offers, I would if you could promise, that a Commissioner, Minister or other Agent would be received, appoint one immediately and renew the effort to enter into conference with a view to secure peace to the two countries.</p>
<p>Yrs &amp;c JEFFN DAVIS</p>
<p>Afterwards, and with the view that it should be shown to Mr. Davis I wrote and delivered to Mr. Blair a letter as follows, to-wit:<span class="ptr"><a name="8_275_3"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_275_3;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[4]</a></span></p>
<p>F. P. Blair, Esq Washington,</p>
<p>Sir: Jan. 18. 1865</p>
<p>Your having shown me Mr. Davis' letter to you of the 12th. Inst. you may say to him that I have constantly been, am now, and shall continue,<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;276</span>
ready to receive any agent whom he, or any other influential person now resisting the national authority, may informally send to me with the view of securing peace to the people of our one common country. Yours &amp;c A. LINCOLN.</p>
<p>Afterwards Mr. Blair dictated for and authorized me to make an entry on the back of my retained copy of the letter last above recited, which entry is as follows.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_276_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_276_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[5]</a></span></p>
<p>January 28. 1865</p>
<p>To-day Mr. Blair tells me that on the 21st. Inst. he delivered to Mr. Davis the original of which the within is a copy, and left it with him; that at the time of delivering it, Mr. Davis read it over twice in Mr. Blair's presence, at the close of which he, Mr. B. remarked that the part about ``our one common country'' related to the part of Mr. D's letter about ``the two countries'' to which Mr. D. replied that he so understood it. A. LINCOLN</p>
<p>Afterwards the Secretary of War placed in my hands the following telegram, indorsed by him, as appears.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_276_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_276_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>From City Point Va. Feby 1st. 10.30 P.M 1865</p>
<p>Hon Edwin M Stanton Secy of War.</p>
<p>Now that the interview between Maj. Eckert, under his written instructions, and Mr Stevens &amp; party, has ended I will state confidentially, but not officially to become a matter of record, that I am convinced, upon conversation with Messrs Stevens &amp; Hunter that their intentions are good and their desire sincere to restore peace and union. I have not felt myself at liberty to express even views of my own or to account for my reticency. This has placed me in an awkward position which I could have avoided by not seeing them in the first instance. I fear now their going back without any expression from any one in authority will have a bad influence. At the same time I recognize the difficulties in the way of receiving these informal commissioners at this time and do not know what to recommend. I am sorry however that Mr Lincoln cannot have an interview with the two named in this despatch if not all three now within our lines. Their letter to me was all that the Presidents instructions contemplated, to secure their safe conduct if they had used the same language to Maj Eckert (signed) U.S. GRANT Lt Genl</p>

<p>Major. In reply to your verbal statement that your instructions did not allow you to alter the conditions upon which a passport could be given to us, we say that we are willing to proceed to Fortress Monroe and there to have an informal conference with any person or persons that President Lincoln may appoint on the basis of his letter to Francis P. Blair of the 18th of Jan'y ult. or upon any other terms, or conditions that he may hereafter propose not inconsistent with the essential principles of self government and popular rights upon which our institutions are founded.</p>
<p>It is our earnest wish to ascertain after a free interchange of ideas and information, upon what principles and terms, if any, a just and honorable peace can be established without the further effusion of blood, and to contribute our utmost efforts to accomplish such a result.</p>
<p>We think it better to add that in accepting your passport we are not to be understood as committing ourselves to anything, but to carry to this informal conference the views and feelings above expressed. Very Respectfully Yours &amp;c (signed) ALEXANDER H. STEPHENS</p>

<p>On the morning of the 3rd., the three gentlemen, Messrs Stephens, Hunter and Campbell, came aboard of our Steamer and had an interview with the Secretary of State and myself of several hours duration. No question of preliminaries to the meeting was then and there made or mentioned. No other person was present; no papers were exchanged, or produced; and it was, in advance, agreed that the conversation was to be informal, and verbal merely.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_284_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_284_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[24]</a></span> On our part, the whole substance of the instructions to the Secretary of State, herein before recited, was stated and insisted upon, and nothing was said inconsistently therewith; while, by the other party it was not said that, in any event, or on any condition, they <span class="rend-i">ever</span> would consent to re-union, and yet they<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;285</span>
equally omitted to declare that they <span class="rend-i">never</span> would so consent. They seemed to desire a postponement of that question, and the adoption of some other course first, which, as some of them, seemed to argue, might, or might not, lead to re-union, but which course, we thought, would amount to an indefinite postponement. The conferrence ended without result. The foregoing, containing, as is believed, all the information sought, is respectfully submitted.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_285_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_285_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; DS, DNA RG 46, Senate 38A F2. See Lincoln's communication to the House of Representatives, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>. The resolution introduced in the House by Thaddeus Stevens and the resolution introduced in the Senate by Charles Sumner were both adopted on February 8. Lincoln's reply was directed to the House as a result of the request of Schuyler Colfax. The report of Secretary Seward, dated February 10, 1865, pointed out that ``the Senate may properly be referred to a special message of the President bearing upon the subject of the resolution and transmitted to the House this day. Appended to this report is a copy of an instruction which has been addressed to Charles Francis Adams, Esq., envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States at London, and which is the only correspondence found in this department touching the subject referred to in the resolution. . . .''</p>
<p>The extract from Seward's letter to Adams, February 7, follows:</p>
<p>``On the morning of the 3d, the President, attended by the Secretary, received Messrs. Stephens, Hunter, and Campbell on board the United States steam transport <span class="rend-i">River Queen</span> in Hampton Roads. The conference was altogether informal. There was no attendance of secretaries, clerks, or other witnesses. Nothing was written or read. The conversation, although earnest and free, was calm, and courteous, and kind on both sides. The Richmond party approached the discussion rather indirectly, and at no time did they either make categorical demands, or tender formal stipulations or absolute refusals. Nevertheless, during the conference, which lasted four hours, the several points at issue between the government and the insurgents were distinctly raised, and discussed fully, intelligently, and in an amicable spirit. What the insurgent party seemed chiefly to favor was a postponement of the question of separation, upon which the war is waged, and a mutual direction of efforts of the government, as well as those of the insurgents, to some extrinsic policy or scheme for a season during which passions might be expected to subside, and the armies be reduced, and trade and intercourse between the people of both sections resumed. It was suggested by them that through such postponement we might now have immediate peace, with some not very certain prospect of an ultimate satisfactory adjustment of political relations between this government and the States, section, or people now engaged in conflict with it.</p>
<p>``This suggestion, though deliberately considered, was nevertheless regarded by the President as one of armistice or truce, and he announced that we can agree to no cessation or suspension of hostilities, except on the basis of the disbandment of the insurgent forces, and the restoration of the national authority throughout all the States in the Union. Collaterally, and in subordination to the proposition which was thus announced, the antislavery policy of the United States was reviewed in all its bearings, and the President announced that he must not be expected to depart from the positions he had heretofore assumed in his proclamation of emancipation and other documents, as these positions were reiterated in his last annual message. It was further declared by the President<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;287</span>
that the complete restoration of the national authority was an indispensable condition of any assent on our part to whatever form of peace might be proposed. The President assured the other party that, while he must adhere to these positions, he would be prepared, so far as power is lodged with the executive, to exercise liberality. His power, however, is limited by the Constitution; and when peace should be made, Congress must necessarily act in regard to appropriations of money and to the admission of representatives from the insurrectionary States. The Richmond party were then informed that Congress had, on the 31st ultimo, adopted by a constitutional majority a joint resolution submitting to the several States the proposition to abolish slavery throughout the Union, and that there is every reason to expect that it will be soon accepted by three-fourths of the States, so as to become a party of the national organic law.</p>
<p>``The conference came to an end by mutual acquiescence, without producing an agreement of views upon the several matters discussed, or any of them. Nevertheless, it is perhaps of some importance that we have been able to submit our opinions and views directly to prominent insurgents, and to hear them in answer in a courteous and not unfriendly manner.''

<p>``2d. That said military authorities be prohibited from imposing upon the people assessments, taxes, duties, or charges, of any kind whatever, and collecting the same, unless authorized so to do specifically by the President or Secretary of War.</p>
<p>``3d. That all officers and soldiers who have served in the armies of the United States and have been honorably discharged from said service, on account of physical disability, and also all such officers and soldiers as shall have served out the term of their enlistment, the same being for three years, shall be held exempt from all military duty, whether militia or otherwise.</p>
<p>``4th. That all persons who have come within the lines of the United States army and taken the oath of amnesty, in good faith, under, and trusting to the assurances of, General Grant's general order No. 10, shall be exempt from such military duty, and so long as they continue to be quiet citizens and obedient to the laws shall be permitted to remain.</p>
<p>``5th. That the people be relieved from the imposition of any other draft than such as is in accordance with law; they do not ask to be exempt from draft, but insist that it be levied upon them in accordance with the laws of the United States and administered by the same rules and regulations as elsewhere in the United States.</p>
<p>``6th. That the President give assurances that so soon as Tennessee shall have ratified the amendments to her Constitution made by the Convention of Nashville, and now being submitted to the people, he will, by proclamation, so far as he lawfully may, declare the State of Tennessee no longer in insurrection against the authority of the United States.</p>

<p>Accompanying the document is a letter from Bland and Wallace, Executive Mansion, Washington, Feb. 11, 1865:</p>
<p>``Having learned this morning that Brig. Genl. [Benjamin H.] Grierson will probably call on you during the day; and knowing him to be more thoroughly<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;296</span>
acquainted with the condition and wants of our people than perhaps any other man in the public service, as also the character and probable worth or worthlessness of the Memphis Millitia as at present organized and the oppressive exactions imposed in its name upon the people---and also how odious to the people is the proposed draft made as they believe without the sanction of law---We beseech you, if any doubts remain in your mind, to question him concerning the matters of relief asked for by us in the printed paper which we had the honor to submit to you several days since. . . .''</p>
<p>If Lincoln's endorsement was sent as a letter or order, the original has not been found. It may have been handed to Grierson during the interview.</p>

Judge Advocate General Washington, Feb. 17. 1865</div>
<p>In regard to the Baltimore and Washington Merchants---clothes dealers---convicted mostly on the testimony of one Worsley (I believe) I have not been quite satisfied. I can not say that the presumption in favor of their innocence has not been shaken; and yet it is very unsatisfactory to me that so many men of fair character should be convicted principally on the testimony of one single man &amp; he of not quite fair character. It occurs to me that they have suffered enough, even if guilty, and enough for example I propose giving them a jubilee, in which course the Sec. of War inclines to concur; but he tells me you are opposed. I write this to ask your cheerful concurrence. Yours truly</p>

<p>``I have received your communications, making application for permission to ship to a loyal State certain cotton alleged to have been raised by you, upon your own plantations, situated within the State of Tennessee.</p>
<p>``If I understand the statements made in your letters the facts are these; that you are the owners of plantations lying in the State of Tennessee, to the north of the City of Memphis; that while such plantations were within the military lines of the United States forces, you planted your crop, but before its maturity the lines of military occupation were contracted, and you were thus thrown beyond them; that the crop was raised in part by your slave labor, notwithstanding which such slave labor was compensated by you in money, in addition to the support and clothing which previous to the rebellion it was customary to allow such laborers, and that the rest of the crop was cultivated by labor, compensated by you.</p>
<p>``You therefore claim under the Act of July 2, 1864, the right under the Regulations, to ship that cotton to a loyal State, upon the payment of the prescribed fees and taxes; but represent that objections are made to such shipment, on the part of the military. The Regulations under the law direct the officers of this Department to grant permits for the shipment to loyal States of the products of insurrectionary States, when such products at the date of the law, or subsequently were within the lines of military occupation provided that such officers are satisfied that such products were raised by the applicants own labor, or the labor of freedmen or others paid by them; and so far as the officers of this Department are concerned, such permits on application by you, would doubtless be granted, on their being satisfied that the provisions of law were fully complied with.</p>

Gov. Fletcher, Washington Feb 20 1865</div>
<p>It seems that there is now no organized military force of the enemy in Missouri and yet that destruction of property and life is rampant every where. Is not the cure for this within easy reach of the people themselves? It cannot but be that every man, not naturally a robber or cut-throat would gladly put an end to this state of things. A large majority in every locality must feel alike upon this subject; and if so they only need to reach an understanding one with another. Each leaving all others alone solves the problem. And surely each would do this but for his apprehension that others will not leave him alone. Can not this mischievous distrust be removed? Let neighborhood meetings be every where called and held, of all entertaining a sincere purpose for mutual security in the future, whatever they may heretofore have thought, said or done about the war or about anything else. Let all such meet and waiving all else pledge each to cease harassing others and to make common cause against whomever persists in making, aiding or encouraging further disturbance. The practical means they will best know how to adopt and apply. At such meetings old friendships will cross the memory; and honor and Christian Charity will come in to help.</p>
<p>Please consider whether it may not be well to suggest this to the now afflicted people of Missouri. Yours truly [A. LINCOLN.]</p>

issued by the Secty of War for the special exchange of Maj. Duval English 11th. Ky. Cav. On the 11th. day of December, Col. Jno. E. Mulford wrote to Dr. J. B.

<p>THE DRAFT.</p>
<p>The following correspondence explains itself:</p>
<p>OFFICE OF THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA, February 18, 1865.</p>
<p><span class="rend-i">Professor E. D. Saunders, D.D</span>.:</p>
<p>MY DEAR SIR: The efficient services that you have heretofore rendered to the community in aiding to fill its quota of recruits, induce the hope that you will again afford the benefit of your time valued efforts, that this city may still be spared from military draft. I am, very respectfully,</p>
<p>ALEXANDER HENRY,</p>
<p>Mayor of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>We concur in the foregoing remarks. JOHN ASHHURST, Chairman,</p>
<p>J. G. ROSENGARTEN, Secretary,</p>
<p>City Bounty Fund Commission.</p>
<p>PHILADELPHIA, February 20, 1865.</p>
<p><span class="rend-i">To His Honor Alexander Henry, Mayor of Philadelphia, and City Bounty Commission</span>:</p>
<p>GENTLEMEN: In view of the certainty and nearness of the military draft about to take place unless extraordinary efforts shall be made to obtain recruits, I accede to your request. Yours, truly, E. D. SAUNDERS.</p>
<p>Beside the clipping John W. Forney endorsed: ``This is a case I would beg of you to favor if I were not too ill to do so in person. I ask it now in writing. J. W. FORNEY''</p>
<p>Stanton endorsed below Lincoln's endorsement:</p>
<p>``Mr President</p>
<p>``1st I think the draft will not be enforced in any State City County or district if this application is yielded to. It presents no ground that may not be urged with equal or greater force in every district The fate of the war therefore may depend upon enforcing the law</p>
<p>``2. You will observe that the application is not made by any City or district authority but only by members of Congress a fraction of a State delegation who have no authority to make a pledge and no promise to keep but who may get a little weak popularity by standing between their constituents and the execution of the law. The connection of [E. D.] Saunders with the matter gives it no strength but excites suspicion of a job in which his fingers are used by men who are unwilling to face the music, or stand bound for his pledges and those of five Congressmen who have no right to pledge any body.</p>
<p>``It is worth your while to notice the printed letter of the Mayor to Saunders pasted on the letter. It asks him to aid <span class="rend-i">in getting recruits</span>---not to paddle off to Washington to postpone the draft. I repeat no local authority nor any respectable citizen save the very respectable delegation in Congress and Mr Forney ask to have the draft suspended or pledge a man to be furnished Saunders is the whole concern.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;313</span>``I am respectfully constrained to advise most earnestly against your interference with the draft in Philadelphia unless you are prepared to give it up altogether. I write on my back in bed but hope you may be able to read what is written.''</p>

Since you wrote the former the whole matter of the negotiations, if it can be so called, has been published, and you, doubtless, have seen it. When you were with me on the evening of the 1st.

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ADfS, DLC-RTL. Following his interview with Lincoln on February 1, Reverend Henry Ward Beecher wrote on February 4:</p>
<p>``The interview and information which you gave me, not only relieved me <span class="rend-i">then</span>, but has, ever since, given me great faith. Even your unexpected visit to Ft Munroe did not stagger me. <span class="rend-i">It has been much criticized</span>. The <span class="rend-i">pride of the</span> nation, is liable to be hurt. Anything that looks like the humiliation of our Government, would be bitterly felt.</p>
<p>``<span class="rend-i">But, I do not criticize it</span>. Knowing the ground on which you stand, and the <span class="rend-i">bases</span> of any negotiation, I am more than willing that, as you will sacrifice <span class="rend-i">no substantial</span> element you should wave any mere formality So that the inside of the hand is solid <span class="rend-i">bone</span>, I am willing to have the outside <span class="rend-i">flesh</span> soft as velvet.</p>
<p>``And I clearly perceive that, whether you gain any point with the <span class="rend-i">south</span> or not, the very extraordinary step, of the Head of a nation, leaving the Capital, and going <span class="rend-i">to</span> the rebels, is an act of condescension which <span class="rend-i">will stop the mouths</span> of <span class="rend-i">Northern enemies</span>.</p>
<p>``No man on earth, was ever before so <span class="rend-i">impregnably</span> placed, as you are. Look at the facts.</p>
<p>``1. The south is exhausted and defeated. The military <span class="rend-i">result is sure</span>.</p>
<p>``2. Every step which you have, one by one taken, toward emancipation &amp; national liberty is now confirmed beyond all change.</p>
<p>``3. You have brought the most dangerous and extraordinary rebellion in history, not only to a successful end, but, have done it without sacrificing <span class="rend-i">republican government</span> even in its forms. It is wonderful, and a sign of Divine help, that democratic institution &amp; feelings, are stronger <span class="rend-i">today</span>---after four years of War, and military administration as enlarged as when all Europe was one camp,---than when you began.</p>
<p>``The north is renovated. Heresy is purged out. Treason is wounded to the death. Our Constitution has felt the hand of God laid upon it, as He said, `Be thou clean' &amp; the leprosy is departed You have now done all that your enemies, even, could ask to shew your desire for peace, &amp; <span class="rend-i">more</span> than many of your friends would wish. Your position is eminent &amp; impregnable. I am only anxious that you should not lose that place. <span class="rend-i">I do not believe that you will</span>. But it is more dangerous <span class="rend-i">to make peace than to make war</span>.</p>
<p>``Why then do I write to you?</p>
<p>``1. Because, it seemed to me, that a man in public office, seeing chiefly political &amp; official people, might be cheered to hear from a private citizen. . . .</p>
<p>``2. Because, I wish to suggest, that, these <span class="rend-i">rumors of peace</span>, and this feverish suspense about commissioners &amp; negotiations, is injurious, in so far as replenishing the army is concerned. . . .</p>
<p>``Would it not be well if the country could be told, deffinitely how the case stands? An address to the army, or to the nation, declaring that <span class="rend-i">peace can come only by arms</span>, if in your judgement the fact is so, would end these feverish uncertainties &amp; give the spring campaign renewed vigor.</p>
<p>``My dear Mr Lincoln, I have written to you, as a friend to a friend. I am<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;319</span>
grateful to God, for raising you up. I believe that you are in His hand. That he may guide you is my daily &amp; almost hourly prayer.</p>
<p>``I hope that it will not seem intrusive in me to write to you. If I add nothing to your wisdom, I might I hope, sometimes cheer you under your great cares.'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>On February 21, Beecher wrote:</p>
<p>``You have enough political reading, &amp; I thought it might serve as a variety to present you another sort. I extract a passage from a letter just received from . . . <span class="rend-i">Persia</span> . . . from Wm. J. Perkins, formerly my tutor in College, now a Missionary.</p>
<p>```We are just now cheered amazingly by the intelligence of President Lincoln's reelection It reached us when our Mission were assembled in a business meeting; and for the first time in thirty years, our sober body was so electrified as to greet the news with a long and loud demonstration of clapping the hands We hail this result as an earnest of the salvation of our beloved country, in the permanent restoration of the Union, and the effectual overthrow of slavery. . . .'''

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS, DNA WR RG 107, Presidential Telegrams, I, 359. Governor Fletcher replied on the same day: ``Your letter of 20th instant has been received. I will diligently, faithfully, and honestly try the policy you suggest, letting none know my utter want of confidence in its success, and preparing for the only other policy as best I can. I will write you to-night. Please withhold any public directions to the military until you receive my letter.'' (OR, I, XLVIII, I, 997).</p>
<p>Fletcher's letter of the same date is as follows:</p>
<p>``I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th Inst. . . .</p>
<p>``I have to say: That the destruction of life and property in every part of Missouri which has been going on for nearly four years and which is yet going on, is not the result of the immediate action of men who can be reached by any amicable propositions. The State being infested with thousands of outlaws who are naturally and practically `robbers' and `cut-throats,' no good man desires to reach any understanding with them. . . . I have every confidence in our ability, when properly organized, to assert by force the supremacy of the law . . . and<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;320</span>
thus give security to . . . every man who is willing to aid in enforcing the law, or to recognize its authority. . . . In almost every neighborhood . . . the loyal men have worked in parties for the last three summers, some standing guard while others ploughed, and all at night sleeping in the woods. No theatre of war has presented scenes of murder and outrage such as we have witnessed in Missouri. . . . Every man in Missouri knows his neighbor. Four years standing guard with or against him leaves no room to doubt the position of each. An agreement to leave `all others alone' would be kept by the good, and only result in advantages to the men who can neither be bound by oaths nor agreements. It would but madden the true men of this State to talk to them of reliance on the `honor' and `christian charity' of these fiends in human shape. When we have sworn them, they have violated their oaths; when we have armed them by agreement to assist in our mutual defence, they have turned their arms against us; when we sought to enrol them for militia duty, they took their guns and either joined Price or went into the bushes to become banditti. . . .</p>
<p>``I am satisfied, Mr. President, that if you could see and fully understand what we have done and suffered in Missouri . . . you would agree . . . that we want no peace with rebels but the peace which comes of unconditional submission to the authority of the law. . . .</p>
<p>``My request by telegraph to-day to withhold any public instructions to the military on the subject of your letter, was prompted by the belief that our soldiers---a majority of whom are soldiers because they cannot live at home in safety---would be exasperated beyond control at the announcement that the men who have driven them from their homes were to be let alone. . . .</p>
<p>``I will go to St Louis tomorrow, and confer with Generals Pope and Dodge as to the best method of fully testing the policy suggested by you, and in the earnest hope that I may be mistaken as to the result. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>On March 7, Fletcher issued a proclamation:</p>
<p>``Whereas there no longer exists within the State of Missouri any organized force of the enemies of the Government of the United States, recognized as entitled to the usages of war among civilized nations; and</p>
<p>``Whereas the supremacy of the civil law is the desire of all good citizens and its protection to those who obey, and its infliction of known and just punishments on those who violate it, are the ends for which governments are established, and the restoration of its power is the sole purpose of the armed forces of the United States and the State of Missouri.</p>
<p>``Now, therefore, I, Thomas C. Fletcher, governor . . . desiring to give to every citizen an opportunity of uniting with the civil authorities for the restoration of peace and order on the basis of the administration of justice, as embodied in the civil law, before the commencement of active operations by the military force now being organized to effect the common object, do invite all men who have not made themselves infamous by crime to unite together for the support of the authority of the officers and laws and to make common cause against whomsoever shall persist in making, aiding, or encouraging any description of lawlessness. . . .''

The accounting officers refuse to pay him as long as the court martial fine, for $20,000 remains in force. Aware of your policy in this class of cases, I have no disposition now and have not had since I learned what your policy was, to press any further consideration of his case, but I respectfully submit that an order might be made by you, directing the payment of any <span class="rend-i">just</span> claim he has without respect to this fine. . . .

Nicolay and Hay, instead of printing the above text, printed a copy of Lincoln's reply on a similar occasion in 1861 (<span class="rend-i">vide supra</span>, February 26, 1861), incorrectly dating it February 9, 1865 (<span class="rend-i">Complete Works</span>, XI, 10). The same error appears in Nicolay and Hay, <span class="rend-i">Abraham Lincoln: A History</span> (X, 142), with an appended footnote explaining that the text which appeared in the <span class="rend-i">Congressional Globe</span> and the newspapers on March 2, 1865, was incorrect, ``having apparently been written out from memory.'' The text appearing in the <span class="rend-i">Congressional Globe</span>, New York <span class="rend-i">Times</span>, and other papers on March 2, was inaccurate to a minor extent, but did follow Lincoln's spoken words better than Nicolay and Hay realized in their<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;327</span></p>
<p>belief that their 1861 speech was the 1865 speech. The errors in the newspapers of March 2, 1865, arose from the fact that an inaccurate and hastily prepared copy was transmitted to congress in lieu of Lincoln's autograph manuscript, which was retained by Representative James F. Wilson of Iowa, who together with Senator Lyman Trumbull and Representative John L. Dawson of Pennsylvania, comprised the notification committee. For a discussion of the inaccurate copy received by congress, see <span class="rend-i">The Collector</span>, XLVIII (January, 1934), 25-27. Further error arose when Hertz printed the newspaper text under date of ``March 4, 1865,'' (I, 143-44).</p>
<p>The autograph manuscript bears on the bottom of the page James F. Wilson's endorsement: ``The above is the original manuscript of Abraham Lincoln's acceptance of his second presidential term, in his own hand writing delivered to the joint committee of Congress appointed to inform him officially of his election.</p>

I couldn't afford to pay a substitute. So I joined the ranks of the people with grievances whom for some time I had been watching and went to the President. I found him in his own room, in dressing-gown and slippers. I told him that I had been drafted, and asked him if he could do anything in my case and in that of Alexander Smith, who was my special friend on the force. He listened to my story as patiently as if he had not heard hundreds like it. I like to remember how kindly he looked at me. When I had finished, he said:</p>
<p>`` `Well, I can't spare you. Come into my office.'</p>

<div class="opener">[Fellow Countrymen:] March 4, 1865</div>
<p>At this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office, there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first. Then a statement, somewhat in detail, of a course to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention, and engrosses the enerergies [<span class="rend-i">sic</span>] of the nation, little that is new could be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself; and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.</p>
<p>On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil-war. All dreaded it---all sought to avert it. While the inaugeral address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to <span class="rend-i">saving</span> the Union without war, insurgent agents were in the city seeking to <span class="rend-i">destroy</span> it without war---seeking to dissol[v]e the Union, and divide effects, by negotiation. Both parties deprecated war; but one of them would <span class="rend-i">make</span> war rather than let the nation survive; and the other would <span class="rend-i">accept</span> war rather than let it perish. And the war came.</p>
<p>One eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the Southern part<span class="ptr"><a name="8_332_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_332_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was, somehow, the cause of the war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union, even by war; while the government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war, the magnitude, or the duration, which it has already<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;333</span>
attained. Neither anticipated that the <span class="rend-i">cause</span> of the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge not that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered; that of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. ``Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!'' If we shall suppose that American Slavery is one of those offences which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South, this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offence came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a Living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope---fervently do we pray---that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-man's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three<span class="ptr"><a name="8_333_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_333_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> thousand years ago, so still it must be said ``the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether.''</p>
<p>With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan---to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.<span class="ptr"><a name="8_333_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_333_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>The 4th section of the law of 16 January, 1857, provides that reserved officers may be promoted on the reserved list, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and under this authority various officers of the navy have been promoted one grade from time to time.</p>
<p>I therefore nominate Commander John J. Young, now on the reserved list, to be a captain in the Navy on the reserved list, from the 12th August, 1854, the date when he was entitled to his regular promotion had he not been overslaughed. It is due to this officer to state that he was passed over in consequence of physical disability, this disability having occurred in the discharge of his duties; and prior to his misfortune he bore the reputation of an efficient and correct officer, and subsequently has evinced a willingness to perform whatever duties were assigned him.</p>

<p>I see your despatch to the Sec. of War, objecting to rebel prisoners being allowed to take the oath and go free. Supposing that I am responsible for what is done in this way, I think fit to say that there is no general rule, or action, allowing prisoners to be discharged merely on taking the oath. What has been done is that Members of Congress come to me from time to time with lists of names alleging that from personal knowledge, and evidence of reliable persons they are satisfied that it is safe to discharge the particular persons named on the lists, and I have ordered their discharge. These Members are chiefly from the border states; and those they get discharged are their neighbors and neighbors sons. They tell me that they do not bring to me one tenth of the names which are brought to them, bringing only such as their knowledge or the proof satisfies them about. I have, on the same principle, discharged some on the representations of others than Members of Congress, as, for instance, Gov. Johnson of Tennessee. The number I have discharged has been rather larger than I liked</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;348</span>---reaching I should think an average of fifty a day, since the recent general exchange commenced. On the same grounds, last year, I discharged quite a number at different times, aggregating perhaps a thousand, Missourians and Kentuckians; and their Members returning here since the prisoner's return to their homes, report to me only two cases of proving false. Doubtless some more have proved false; but, on the whole I believe what I have done in this way has done good rather than harm. A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>``Your letter of the 13th was handed to me yesterday by your messenger. You say you know of no personal, political or official objection to my re-appointment. From other parts of your letter I am lead to infer that you think I may not care about being re-appointed because the office is of no pecuniary consequence to me. If this be so you would be glad to have the disposal of it, &amp; to ascertain whether it be so is the purpose of your letter. As you are one of the frankest of men, I assume that you desire the utmost frankness from me. You desire me to state as between friends, &amp; confidentially, precisely what the fact is on these points. . . . So understanding your letter I say frankly &amp; truly---that I do desire a re-appointment, &amp; one of the strong reasons for this desire . . . is that the office is a matter of `pecuniary' importance to me, and have entertained the hope that it will be. Hitherto, as I will explain, it has not been.</p>
<p>``I entered the office comparatively poor. I had some factory property . . . but no supplies or working capital. . . . In about a year the factory began to make money &amp; continued to do a successful business till about six months ago. . . .</p>
<p>``During the time of my greatest prosperity I made a donation to Williams College. . . . I have said to my wife once or twice that if part of it had not been made, I should not make it now. . . . Part was a large Gymnasium Building which I agreed to erect, at a cost not to exceed $15,000. . . . It is now perhaps ¾ down &amp; the cost . . . will reach $25,000. I have several times comforted myself with the hope . . . that if I should be allowed to keep my office another term, I might in that way make up this extra $10,000. . . . I say . . . that I have made nothing hitherto by my office, nor do I think there is a man in Boston who believes I have. Still I feel . . . that should the war close soon . . . I shall be fairly entitled to the pecuniary advantages of it for the remainder of another term. But of this you will judge. There is no man living I would sooner relieve from embarrassment than yourself. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>Lincoln probably wished to find a place for retiring Vice-president Hannibal Hamlin. Charles Sumner's letter to Hamlin, August 22, 1865, explained how Hamlin got the appointment later from President Johnson:</p>
<p>``It seemed to [Henry] Wilson and myself that before deciding on your course you ought to know the history of the recent change at our custom-house, and we hoped for an opportunity of speaking of it freely in a personal interview. As you may not be here very soon, I will give the narrative.</p>
<p>``Some time ago Mr. Hooper [Representative Samuel Hooper of Boston] received a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury, stating that the administration desired to change the three officers at the custom-house whose salaries were large, and he asked him to confer with the two senators and Mr. [Alexander H.] Rice, and send him the names which we should agree upon for the places. We concluded to confine the conference to those indicated, and I invited the whole delegation to meet at my house. . . .</p>
<p>``At the meeting . . . I stated that, on general grounds, I was against a change---that I doubted its policy, but that I should cooperate cheerfully . . . in making the desired recommendations. I then proceeded to propose Mr. Hamlin for collector. It was evident at once that there was a strong disposition in all the delegation towards Mr. Hamlin; but it was remarked that the naval office was easier in its duties . . . the delegation overruled my proposition and recommended Mr. Hamlin for naval officer. . . . Some days later Mr. Hooper received a letter<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;353</span>
from the secretary stating that the President wished to offer Mr. Hamlin the alternative of these two offices. This is all we know. . . .'' (Charles Eugene Hamlin, <span class="rend-i">The Life and Times of Hannibal Hamlin</span>, pp. 501-502).</p>

<p>I think it will tend to remove some injurious misunderstanding for you to have another interview with Judge Hughes. I do not wish to modify anything I have heretofore said, as to you having entire control whether anything in the way of trade shall pass either way through your lines. I do say, however, that having known Judge Hughes intimately during the whole of the rebellion, I do not believe he would knowingly betray any interest of the country and attempt to deceive you in the slightest degree.

<p>``Saw in the papers this morning the statement that 200,000 pounds of tobacco purchased by Genl Singleton in Richmond and sent to Fredericksburgh had been destroyed by our troops. . . . Knowing . . . that Singleton had written authority from the President to go to Richmond &amp; purchase and bring out produce . . . I was greatly surprised. . . . Just at night I took Judge Hughes with me, and went to the Presidents. . . . The President at once showed us despatches from Genl Grant . . . saying substantially that Genl Singleton and Judge Hughes were at Richmond engaged in a stupendous scheme to make millions . . . that they were willing to sacrifice the interests of the Country to the accomplishment of their purpose. . . . This astonished me greatly. Hughes had not been in Richmond. All that Singleton had done had been open and above board. . . . The President had not seen the paper Grant had given to Singleton authorising him to send products to Fredericksburg, and guarantying protection. I had a copy . . . which I showed to the President, and I think he was not less amazed at Grants subsequent conduct than I was. He seemed troubled and perplexed . . . and manifested a desire to keep faith, and save Singleton from ruin if he could, but at the same time gave me the impression that he was afraid to take the responsibility.</p>
<p>``I thought he was afraid of Secy Stanton, although he said Stanton had always been in favor of getting out products. I suggested that I would see, and converse, with Mr Stanton upon the subject, and he urged me to do so. He also thought that Judge Hughes ought to go down and see Grant, saying he would give him a pass to go, and also write a letter to Grant. . . .''</p>
<p>Under date of March 21, Browning records a conversation with Stanton, in which it was developed that the tobacco destroyed did not belong to James W. Singleton and James Hughes.</p>

<p>Every one likes a compliment. Thank you for yours on my little notification speech, and on the recent Inaugeral Address. I expect the latter to wear as well as---perhaps better than---any thing I have produced; but I believe it is not immediately popular. Men are not flattered by being shown that there has been a difference of purpose between the Almighty and them. To deny it, however, in this case, is to deny that there is a God governing the world. It is a truth which I thought needed to be told; and as whatever of humiliation there is in it, falls most directly on myself, I thought others might afford for me to tell it. Yours truly</p>

<p>[Autograph Draft]</p>
<p>FELLOW CITIZENS. A few words only. I was born in Kentucky, raised in Indiana, reside in Illinois, and now here, it is my duty to care equally for the good people of all the States. I am to-day glad of seeing it in the power of an Indianana regiment to present this captured flag to the good governor of their State. And yet I would not wish to compliment Indiana above other states, remembering that all have done so well. There are but few aspects of this great war on which I have not already expressed my views by speaking or writing. There is one---the recent effort of our erring bretheren, sometimes so-called, to employ the slaves in their armies. The great question with them has been; ``will the negro fight for them?'' They ought to know better than we; and, doubtless, do know better than we. I may incidentally remark, however, that having, in my life, heard many arguments,---or strings of words meant to pass for arguments,---intended to show that the negro ought to be a<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;361</span>
slave, that if he shall now really fight to keep himself a slave, it will be a far better argument why [he] should remain a slave than I have ever before heard. He, perhaps, ought to be a slave, if he desires it ardently enough to fight for it. Or, if one out of four will, for his own freedom, fight to keep the other three in slavery, he ought to be a slave for his selfish meanness. I have always thought that all men should be free; but if any should be slaves it should be first those who desire it for <span class="rend-i">themselves</span>, and secondly those who <span class="rend-i">desire</span> it for <span class="rend-i">others</span>. Whenever [I] hear any one,<span class="ptr"><a name="8_361_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_361_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> arguing for slavery I feel a strong impulse to see it tried on him personally.</p>
<p>There is one thing about the negroes fighting for the rebels which we can know as well [as] they can; and that is that they can not, at [the] same time fight in their armies, and stay at home and make bread for them. And this being known and remembered we can have but little concern whether they become soldiers or not. I am rather in favor of the measure; and would at any time if I could, have loaned them a vote to carry it. We have to reach the bottom of the insurgent resources; and that they employ, or seriously think of employing, the slaves as soldiers, gives us glimpses of the bottom. Therefore I am glad of what we learn on this subject.</p>
<p>[Newspaper Version]</p>
<p>FELLOW CITIZENS---It will be but a very few words that I shall undertake to say. I was born in Kentucky, raised in Indiana and lived in Illinois. (Laughter.) And now I am here, where it is my business to care equally for the good people of all the States. I am glad to see an Indiana regiment on this day able to present the captured flag to the Governor of Indiana. (Applause.) I am not disposed, in saying this, to make a distinction between the States, for all have done equally well. (Applause.) There are but few views or aspects of this great war upon which I have not said or written something whereby my own opinions might be known. But there is one---the recent attempt of our erring brethren, as they are sometimes called---(laughter)---to employ the negro to fight for them. I have neither written nor made a speech on that subject, because that was their business, not mine; and if I had a wish upon the subject I had not the power to introduce it, or make it effective. The great question with them was, whether the negro, being put into the army, would fight for them. I do not know, and therefore cannot decide. (Laughter.) They ought to know better than we. I have in my lifetime heard many arguments why the negroes ought to be slaves; but if they fight for those who would keep them in slavery it will be a better argument than any I have yet heard.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;362</span>(Laughter and applause.) He who will fight for that ought to be a slave. (Applause.) They have concluded at last to take one out of four of the slaves, and put them in the army; and that one out of the four who will fight to keep the others in slavery ought to be a slave himself unless he is killed in a fight. (Applause.) While I have often said that all men ought to be free, yet I would allow those colored persons to be slaves who want to be; and next to them those white persons who argue in favor of making other people slaves. (Applause.) I am in favor of giving an opportunity to such white men to try it on for themselves. (Applause.) I will say one thing in regard to the negro being employed to fight for them. I do know he cannot fight and stay at home and make bread too---(laughter and applause)---and as one is about as important as the other to them, I don't care which they do. (Renewed applause.) I am rather in favor of<span class="ptr"><a name="8_362_1"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_362_1;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[3]</a></span> having them try them as soldiers. (Applause.) They lack one vote of doing that, and I wish I could send my vote over the river so that I might cast it in favor of allowing the negro to fight. (Applause.) But they cannot fight and work both. We must now see the bottom of the enemy's resources. They will stand out as long as they can, and if the negro will fight for them, they must allow him to fight. They have drawn upon their last branch of resources. (Applause.) And we can now see the bottom. (Applause.) I am glad to see the end so near at hand. (Applause.) I have said now more than I intended, and will therefore bid you goodby.</p>

<p>I am unwilling for the sentence to stand and be executed, to any extent in this case. In the absence of a more adequate motive than the evidence discloses, I am wholly unable to believe in the existence of criminal or fraudulent intent on the part of one of such well established good character as is the accused. If the evidence went as far toward establishing a guilty profit of one or two hundred thousand dollars, as it does of one or two hundred dollars, the case would, on the question of guilt, bear a far different aspect. That on this contract, involving from one million to twelve hundred thousand dollars, the contractors should attempt a fraud which at the most could profit them only one or two hundred, or even one thousand dollars, is to my mind beyond the power of rational belief. That they did not, in such a case, strike for greater gains proves that they did not, with guilty, or fraudulent intent, strike at all. The judgment and sentence are disapproved, and declared null, and the accused ordered to be discharged.</p>

Pope's lengthy reply of March 3 may be found in OR, I, XLVIII, I, 1070-77. In substance it sets forth that the civil authority should recognize its responsibilities and perform its duties.</p>
<p>On March 8, Pope had written Lincoln:</p>
<p>``I . . . transmit . . . a printed copy [clipping from the <span class="rend-i">Missouri Republican</span>, March 8, 1865] of a letter addressed by me to the Governor of Missouri. . . .</p>
<p>``In addition to what is set forth in the letter . . . I . . . submit for your consideration a few . . . suggestions, which it was perhaps well not to make public in my letter to Gov. Fletcher. I ask your consideration of these suggestions and of those contained in the printed letter, and if they meet your approval I . . . request that I may be so notified. . . .</p>
<p>``It is . . . desirable that . . . the General Government be relieved from all concern in the civil affairs of the State, and be required only to defend it against armed invasion. So long as United States troops remain in Missouri . . . they will be a constant source of embarassment and a difficult obstacle to the renewal of civil administration. . . . So long as the troops remain and . . . Martial Law obtains the people will feel a constant desire to appeal from the State Executive and the Civil laws, to the Military Authorities and to the General Government; and no step will be taken toward a resumption of local civil administration. . . . Remove that source of difficulty, and they will soon learn, that they must depend upon themselves and their state government, as their final resort for justice.</p>
<p>``I do not propose to change the present condition of the military suddenly, but . . . cautiously and gradually, as follows.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;366</span>``The term of the Missouri State Militia . . . paid by the General Government and . . . under officers of the United States is about to expire. . . . Under no circumstances should these troops be reorganized or employed in the same manner. . . . No authority should be given to raise troops for service in Missouri. If these recommendations be adopted, we shall be left . . . within a few months, with nothing but a few regiments of Volunteers from other States. These . . . I will push down to the Southern border of the State. . . .</p>
<p>``In many counties . . . the civil courts are in full operation. In those . . . I propose to suspend Martial law, not by any public order, but simply by private instructions to commanding officers to withdraw their Provost Marshals and to refrain . . . from any interference with citizens. . . . Slowly, county by county, the military forces of the United States can thus be withdrawn from all connection with the . . . civil affairs of the State. If troops or Martial Law are afterwards required . . . let the Governor take the responsibility of declaring Martial Law and enforcing it by his State Militia. . . .</p>
<p>``There is a loyal State executive and civil officers and a large loyal majority in the State and I cannot see why it is not abundantly able to settle all controversies between its own citizens, without referring them to the Administration at Washington. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>

<p>The office of solicitor for the War Department remained vacant for some time after William Whiting's resignation. James E.

Yeatman declined the appointment according to the <span class="rend-i">Dictionary of American Biography</span>.</p>
<p>Concerning Earl John Russell's communication to the Confederate States, General Robert E. Lee wrote Confederate Secretary of War John C. Breckinridge on March 16, 1865:</p>
<p>``I have received the papers recently forwarded by me, with the instructions to return them to General Grant. . . . At the time General Grant sent the papers to me I only acknowledged the receipt of them without saying what disposition I would make of them. I hoped that this would render it unnecessary to take any further notice of the matter, but as it is deemed proper to reply, and the fact that the communication of Earl Russell was forwarded at his request may render a reply necessary, I beg leave . . . to suggest that the refusal of the Government to hold intercourse with neutral nations through the medium selected by Lord Russell, would seem to be sufficient for all purposes.</p>
<p>``The addition of a doubt as to the authenticity of the document would seem to be unnecessary after such a general refusal to receive any communication through the channel selected, and may weaken the force of that refusal, by leading to the inference that a duly authenticated paper would be received, if forwarded in the objectionable manner, through the hands and under the inspection of the enemy. . . .''

<p>Hon. Secretary of War: I begin to feel that I ought to be at home, and yet I dislike to leave without seeing nearer to the end of General Grant's present movement. He has now been out since yesterday morning, and although he has not been diverted from his programme, no considerable effect has yet been produced, so far as we know here. Last night at 10.15, when it was dark as a rainy night without a moon could be, a furious cannonade, soon joined in by a heavy musketry-fire, opened near Petersburg and lasted about two hours. The sound was very distinct here, as also were the flashes of the guns upon the clouds. It seemed to me a great battle, but the older hands here scarcely noticed it, and, sure enough, this morning it was found that very little had been done. A. LINCOLN.</p>

<p>As to peace, I have said before, and now repeat, that three things are indispensable.</p>
<p>1. The restoration of the national authority throughout all the States.</p>
<p>2. No receding by the Executive of the United States on the slavery question, from the position assumed thereon, in the late Annual Message to Congress, and in preceding documents.</p>
<p>3. No cessation of hostilities short of an end of the war, and the disbanding of all force hostile to the government.</p>
<p>That all propositions coming from those now in hostility to the government; and not inconsistent with the foregoing, will be respectfully considered, and passed upon in a spirit of sincere liberality.</p>
<p>I now add that it seems useless for me to be more specific with those who will not say they are ready for the indispensable terms, even on conditions to be named by themselves. If there be any who are ready for those indispensable terms, on any conditions whatever, let them say so, and state their conditions, so that such conditions can be distinctly known, and considered.</p>
<p><span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;387</span>It is further added that, the remission of confiscations being within the executive power, if the war be now further persisted in, by those opposing the government, the making of confiscated property at the least to bear the additional cost, will be insisted on; but that confiscations (except in cases of third party intervening interests) will be remitted to the people of any State which shall now promptly, and in good faith, withdraw it's troops and other support, from further resistance to the government.</p>
<p>What is now said as to remission of confiscations has no reference to supposed property in slaves.</p>

Dana telegraphed Stanton at 4 P.M.: ``Judge Campbell . . . had an interview with the President here this morning to consider how Virginia can be brought back to the Union. All they ask is an amnesty and a military convention, to cover appearances. Slavery they admit to be defunct. General Weitzel, who was present, tells me that the President did not promise the amnesty, but told them he had the pardoning power, and would save any repentant sinner from hanging. They . . . are sure if amnesty could be offered the rebel army would dissolve and all the States return. The President went to City Point this morning, and I have not been able to see him.'' (OR, I, XLVI, III, 575).</p>
<p>On April 7, Dana telegraphed Stanton further: ``Meeting of five members of the Virginia legislature held here to-day upon the President's propositions to Judge Campbell. The President showed me the papers confidentially to-day. They are two in number, one without address [<span class="rend-i">supra</span>], the other . . . to General Weitzel [April 6, <span class="rend-i">infra</span>]. The one states <span class="rend-i">sine qua non</span> of reunion, and does not differ essentially from previous statements. The second authorizes Weitzel to allow members of the body claiming to be legislature of Virginia to meet here for purpose of recalling Virginia soldiers from rebel armies, with safe conduct to them, so long as they do and say nothing hostile to the United States. Judge Campbell laid these papers before the five men. . . . The President told me this morning that Sheridan seemed to be getting Virginia soldiers out of the war faster than this legislature could think. . . .''

<p>Secretary Seward was thrown from his carriage yesterday and seriously injured. This, with other matters, will take me to Washington soon. I was at Richmond yesterday and the day before, when and where Judge Campbell (who was with Messrs. Hunter and Stephens in February) called on me and made such representations as induced me to put in his hands an informal paper, repeating the propositions in my letter of instructions to Mr. Seward (which you remember) and adding that if the war be now further persisted in by the rebels, confiscated property shall, at the least, bear the additional cost; and that confiscations shall be remitted to the people of any State which will now promptly, and in good faith, withdraw its troops and other support, from resistance to the government. Judge Campbell thought it not impossible that the rebel Legislature of Virginia would do the latter, if permitted; and accordingly, I addressed a private letter to Gen. Weitzel (with permission for Judge Campbell to see it) telling him, Gen. W. that if they attempt this, to permit and protect them, unless they attempt something hostile to the United States, in which case to give them notice and time to leave, and to arrest any remaining after such time.</p>
<p>I do not think it very probable that anything will come of this; but I have thought best to notify you, so that if you should see signs, you may understand them. From your recent despatches it seems that you are pretty effectually withdrawing the Virginia troops from opposition to the government. Nothing I have done, or probably shall do, is to delay, hinder, or interfere with you in your work. Yours truly A. LINCOLN</p>

I found that the 2d Corps was engaged to the front &amp; right &amp; the Cavalry heavily to my left moving down the road towards Burks Station perhaps a mile &amp; turning sharp to right I proceeded across toward a nearly paralel road on which the Enemy was moving &amp; along which he had thrown up a line of entrenchments as soon as the leading Division Gen [Truman] Seymours could be formed it was moved upon the road held by the Enemy which was carried then turning to the left it was advanced down the road against a pretty strong resistance by this time [Frank] Wheatons Division was put in position as rapidly as possible on Seymours left the lines were again advanced &amp; we swept down the road for a distance of about 2 miles arriving at a Deep &amp; difficult creek we<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;392</span>
found the Enemy had reformed his line on the opposite side where we attacked &amp; drove him to a point a distance of a half mile further In the 1st attack a portion of the Cavalry operated on our right flank in its subsequent attacks the mass of cavalry operated on our left &amp; right flank of the Enemy. The result has been a complete success.

The <span class="rend-i">Intelligencer's</span> account of the occasion is as follows:</p>
<p>``The procession proceeded along Pennsylvania avenue gaining accessions at every step, despite the mud and rain, and when it turned up Fifteenth street it is estimated that there were over three thousand persons in the crowd. The procession proper---that is, those who had come from the Navy Yard---and a portion of the crowd proceeded to the residence of Secretary Welles, while the other portion kept along Pennsylvania avenue to the White House and the War Department. At the latter place the band of the Quartermaster's regiment, Capt. Tompkins, under the leadership of Prof. Blish, and the band of the Fourteenth regiment V.R.C., were stationed, and their excellent music attracted an immense concourse of people, who called again loudly for Secretary Stanton, but failing to get him out, the crowd, preceded by the Quartermaster's band, moved toward the White House, and in a few moments an immense number of people were assembled, and completely filled the portico, the carriageway, and pavements on either side, while many were forced to content themselves with a stand-up place in the mud. The bands played, the howitzers belched forth their thunder, and the people cheered. Call after call was made for the President, and his failure to appear only made the people cry out the louder. Master Tad Lincoln, who was at the window, appeared to hugely enjoy the shouting, cheering, and swaying to and fro of the crowd, who evinced a determination not to depart until the Chief Magistrate acknowledged their greeting by his presence. At length, after persistent effort, the presence of Mr. Lincoln was secured. Three loud and hearty cheers were given, after which the President said: [as above]</p>
<p>``In accordance with the request, the band struck up `Dixie,' and at its conclusion<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;394</span>
played `Yankee Doodle,' the President remaining at the window mean-while.</p>
<p>``The President then said: `Now give three good hearty cheers for General Grant and all under his command.' These were given with a will, after which Mr. Lincoln requested `three more cheers for our gallant Navy,' which request was also readily granted.</p>
<p>``The President then disappeared from the window, amid the cheers of those below. The crowd then moved back to the War Department, and loud calls were again made for Secretary Stanton.''</p>

<p>MY FRIENDS: I am informed that you have assembled here this afternoon under the impression that I had made an appointment to speak at this time. This is a mistake. I have made no such appointment. More or less persons have been gathering here at different times during the day, and in the exuberance of their feeling, and for all of which they are greatly justified, calling upon me to say something; and I have, from time to time, been sending out what I supposed was proper to disperse them for the present. [Laughter and applause.]</p>
<p>I said to a larger audience this morning what I desire now to repeat. It is this: That I supposed in consequence of the glorious news we have been receiving lately, there is to be some general demonstration, either on this or to-morrow evening, when I will be expected, I presume, to say something. Just here I will remark that I would much prefer having this demonstration take place to-morrow evening, as I would then be much better prepared to say what I have to say than I am now or can be this evening. [A voice---``And we will then have heard from Johnston.'']</p>
<p>I therefore say to you that I shall be quite willing, and I hope ready, to say something then; whereas just now I am not ready to say anything that one in my position ought to say. Everything I say, you know, goes into print. [Laughter and applause.] If I make a mistake it doesn't merely affect me nor you but the country. I, therefore, ought at least try not to make mistakes. [Voices---``You have made no mistakes yet.'']</p>
<p>If, then, a general demonstration be made to-morrow evening, and it is agreeable, I will endeavor to say something, and not make a mistake, without at least trying carefully to avoid it. [Laughter and applause.] Thanking you for the compliment of this call, I bid you good evening.</p>

<p>By the President of the United States of America:</p>
<p>A Proclamation.</p>
<p>Whereas, by my Proclamations of the nineteenth and twenty seventh days of April, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, the ports of the United States in the States of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas, were declared to be subject to blockade; but whereas the said blockade has, in consequence of actual military occupation by this Government, since been conditionally set aside or relaxed in respect to the ports of Norfolk and Alexandria, in the State of Virginia, Beaufort in the State of North Carolina, Port Royal in the State of South Carolina, Pensacola and Fernandina in the State of Florida, and New Orleans in the State of Louisiana:</p>
<p>And, whereas, by the fourth section of the Act of Congress approved on the thirteenth of July eighteen hundred and sixty one, entitled ``An act further to provide for the collection of duties on imports and for other purposes,'' the President, for the reasons therein set forth, is authorized to close certain ports of entry;</p>
<p>Now, therefore, be it known, that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, do hereby proclaim that the ports of Richmond, Tappahannock, Cherrystone, Yorktown and Petersburg in Virginia; of Camden, (Elizabeth City,) Edenton, Plymouth, Washington, Newbern, Ocracoke and Wilmington, in North Carolina; of Charleston, Georgetown and Beaufort in South Carolina; of Savannah, St. Mary's and Brunswick, (Darien) in Georgia; of Mobile in Alabama; of Pearl River, (Shieldsborough,) Natchez and Vicksburg in Mississippi; of St. Augustine, Key West, St. Marks, (Port Leon,) St. John's, (Jacksonville,) and Apalachicola, in Florida; of Teché, (Franklin) in Louisiana; of Galveston, La Salle, Brazos de Santiago, (Point Isabel,) and Brownsville, in Texas, are hereby closed, and all right of importation, warehousing, and other privileges shall, in respect to the ports aforesaid, cease until they shall have again been opened by order of the President; and if, while said ports are so closed, any ship or vessel from beyond the United States or having on board any articles subject to duties, shall attempt to enter any such port, the same, together with its tackle, apparel, furniture and cargo, shall be forfeited to the United States.</p>

<div class="opener">April 11, 1865</div>
<p>We meet this evening, not in sorrow, but in gladness of heart. The evacuation of Petersburg and Richmond, and the surrender of the principal insurgent army, give hope of a righteous and speedy peace whose joyous expression can not be restrained. In the midst of this, however, He, from Whom all blessings flow, must not be forgotten. A call for a national thanksgiving is being<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;400</span>
prepared, and will be duly promulgated. Nor must those whose harder part gives us the cause of rejoicing, be overlooked. Their honors must not be parcelled out with others. I myself, was near the front, and had the high pleasure of transmitting much of the good news to you; but no part of the honor, for plan or execution, is mine. To Gen. Grant, his skilful officers, and brave men, all belongs. The gallant Navy stood ready, but was not in reach to take active part.</p>
<p>By these recent successes the re-inauguration of the national authority---reconstruction---which has had a large share of thought from the first, is pressed much more closely upon our attention. It is fraught with great difficulty. Unlike the case of a war between independent nations, there is no authorized organ for us to treat with. No one man has authority to give up the rebellion for any other man. We simply must begin with, and<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;401</span>
mould from, disorganized and discordant elements. Nor is it a small additional embarrassment that we, the loyal people, differ among ourselves as to the mode, manner, and means of reconstruction.</p>
<p>As a general rule, I abstain from reading the reports of attacks upon myself, wishing not to be provoked by that to which I can not properly offer an answer. In spite of this precaution, however, it comes to my knowledge that I am much censured for some supposed agency in setting up, and seeking to sustain, the new State Government of Louisiana. In this I have done just so much as, and no more than, the public knows. In the Annual Message of Dec. 1863 and accompanying Proclamation, I presented <span class="rend-i">a</span> plan of re-construction (as the phrase goes) which, I promised, if adopted by any State, should be acceptable to, and sustained by, the Executive government of the nation. I distinctly stated that this was<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;402</span>
not the only plan which might possibly be acceptable; and I also distinctly protested that the Executive claimed no right to say when, or whether members should be admitted to seats in Congress from such States. This plan was, in advance, submitted to the then Cabinet, and distinctly approved by every member of it. One of them suggested that I should then, and in that connection, apply the Emancipation Proclamation to the theretofore excepted parts of Virginia and Louisiana; that I should drop the suggestion about apprenticeship for freed-people, and that I should omit the protest against my own power, in regard to the admission of members to Congress; but even he approved every part and parcel of the plan which has since been employed or touched by the action of Louisiana. The new constitution of Louisiana, declaring emancipation for the whole State, practically applies the Proclamation to the part previously excepted. It does not adopt apprenticeship for freed-people; and it is silent, as it could not well be otherwise, about the admission of members to Congress. So that, as it applies to Louisiana, every member of the Cabinet fully approved the plan. The Message went to Congress, and I received many commendations of the plan, written and verbal; and not a single objection to it, from any professed emancipationist, came to my knowledge, until after the news reached Washington that the people of Louisiana had begun to move in accordance with it. From about July 1862, I had corresponded with different persons, supposed to be interested, seeking a reconstruction of a State government for Louisiana. When the Message of 1863, with the plan before mentioned, reached New-Orleans, Gen. Banks wrote me that he was confident the people, with his military co-operation, would reconstruct, substantially on that plan. I wrote him, and some of them to try it; they tried it, and the result is known. Such only has been my agency in getting up the Louisiana government. As to sustaining it, my promise is out, as before stated. But, as bad promises are better broken than kept, I shall treat this as a bad promise, and break it, whenever I shall be convinced that keeping it is adverse to the public interest. But I have not yet been so convinced.</p>
<p>I have been shown a letter on this subject, supposed to be an able one, in which the writer expresses regret that my mind has not seemed to be definitely fixed on the question whether the seceded States, so called, are in the Union or out of it. It would perhaps, add astonishment to his regret, were he to learn that since I have found professed Union men endeavoring to make that question, I have <span class="rend-i">purposely</span> forborne any public expression upon<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;403</span>
it. As appears to me that question has not been, nor yet is, a practically material one, and that any discussion of it, while it thus remains practically immaterial, could have no effect other than the mischievous one of dividing our friends. As yet, whatever it may hereafter become, that question is bad, as the basis of a controversy, and good for nothing at all---a merely pernicious abstraction.</p>
<p>We all agree that the seceded States, so called, are out of their proper practical relation with the Union; and that the sole object of the government, civil and military, in regard to those States is to again get them into that proper practical relation. I believe it is not only possible, but in fact, easier, to do this, without deciding, or even considering, whether these states have even been out of the Union, than with it. Finding themselves safely at home, it would be utterly immaterial whether they had ever been abroad. Let us all join in doing the acts necessary to restoring the proper practical relations between these states and the Union; and each forever after, innocently indulge his own opinion whether, in doing the acts, he brought the States from without, into the Union, or only gave them proper assistance, they never having been out of it.</p>
<p>The amount of constituency, so to to [<span class="rend-i">sic</span>] speak, on which the new Louisiana government rests, would be more satisfactory to all, if it contained fifty, thirty, or even twenty thousand, instead of only about twelve thousand, as it does. It is also unsatisfactory to some that the elective franchise is not given to the colored man. I would myself prefer that it were now conferred on the very intelligent, and on those who serve our cause as soldiers. Still the question is not whether the Louisiana government, as it stands, is quite all that is desirable. The question is ``Will it be wiser to take it as it is, and help to improve it; or to reject, and disperse it?'' ``Can Louisiana be brought into proper practical relation with the Union <span class="rend-i">sooner</span> by <span class="rend-i">sustaining</span>, or by <span class="rend-i">discarding</span> her new State Government?''</p>
<p>Some twelve thousand voters in the heretofore slave-state of Louisiana have sworn allegiance to the Union, assumed to be the rightful political power of the State, held elections, organized a State government, adopted a free-state constitution, giving the benefit of public schools equally to black and white, and empowering the Legislature to confer the elective franchise upon the colored man. Their Legislature has already voted to ratify the constitutional amendment recently passed by Congress, abolishing slavery throughout the nation. These twelve thousand persons are<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;404</span>
thus fully committed to the Union, and to perpetual freedom in the state---committed to the very things, and nearly all the things the nation wants---and they ask the nations recognition, and it's assistance to make good their committal. Now, if we reject, and spurn them, we do our utmost to disorganize and disperse them. We in effect say to the white men ``You are worthless, or worse---we will neither help you, nor be helped by you.'' To the blacks we say ``This cup of liberty which these, your old masters, hold to your lips, we will dash from you, and leave you to the chances of gathering the spilled and scattered contents in some vague and undefined when, where, and how.'' If this course, discouraging and paralyzing both white and black, has any tendency to bring Louisiana into proper practical relations with the Union, I have, so far, been unable to perceive it. If, on the contrary, we recognize, and sustain the new government of Louisiana the converse of all this is made true. We encourage the hearts, and nerve the arms of the twelve thousand to adhere to their work, and argue for it, and proselyte for it, and fight for it, and feed it, and grow it, and ripen it to a complete success. The colored man too, in seeing all united for him, is inspired with vigilance, and energy, and daring, to the same end. Grant that he desires the elective franchise, will he not attain it sooner by saving the already advanced steps toward it, than by running backward over them? Concede that the new government of Louisiana is only to what it should be as the egg is to the fowl, we shall sooner have the fowl by hatching the egg than by smashing it? Again, if we reject Louisiana, we also reject one vote in favor of the proposed amendment to the national constitution. To meet this proposition, it has been argued that no more than three fourths of those States which have not attempted secession are necessary to validly ratify the amendment. I do not commit myself against this, further than to say that such a ratification would be questionable, and sure to be persistently questioned; while a ratification by three fourths of all the States would be unquestioned and unquestionable.</p>
<p>I repeat the question. ``Can Louisiana be brought into proper practical relation with the Union <span class="rend-i">sooner</span> by <span class="rend-i">sustaining</span> or by <span class="rend-i">discarding</span> her new State Government?</p>
<p>What has been said of Louisiana will apply generally to other States. And yet so great peculiarities pertain to each state; and such important and sudden changes occur in the same state; and, withal, so new and unprecedented is the whole case, that no exclusive, and inflexible plan can safely be prescribed as to details and colatterals. Such exclusive, and inflexible plan, would surely<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;405</span>
become a new entanglement. Important principles may, and must, be inflexible.</p>
<p>In the present ``<span class="rend-i">situation</span>'' as the phrase goes, it may be my duty to make some new announcement to the people of the South. I am considering, and shall not fail to act, when satisfied that action will be proper.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; AD-P, ISLA. On April 11, Salmon P. Chase had written Lincoln at length about reconstruction:</p>
<p>``I am very anxious about the future: and most about the principles which are to govern reconstruction for as these principles are sound or unsound so will be the work &amp; its results. . . .</p>
<p>``And first as to Virginia.</p>
<p>``By the action of every branch of the Government we are committed to the recognition &amp; maintenance of the State organization of which Governor Pierpont is the head. You know all the facts. . . . There will be a pressure for the recognition of the rebel organization on condition of profession of loyalty. It will be far easier and wiser, in my judgment, to stand by the loyal organization already recognized.</p>
<p>``And next as to the other rebel States:</p>
<p>``The easiest &amp; safest way seems to me to be the enrollment of the loyal citizens without regard to complexion and encouragement &amp; support to them in the reorganization of State Governments under constitutions securing suffrage to all citizens. . . . This you know has long been my opinion. . . .</p>
<p>``This way is recommended by its simplicity, facility &amp; above all, justice. It will be, hereafter, counted equally a crime &amp; a folly if the colored loyalists of the rebel states shall be left to the control of restored rebels, not likely, in that case, to be either wise or just, until taught both wisdom and justice by new calamities.</p>
<p>``The application of this principle to Louisiana is made somewhat difficult by the organization which has already taken place: but happily the Constitution enables the Legislature to extend the right of suffrage. . . .</p>
<p>``The same result can be assured in Arkansas by an amendment of the state constitution; or what would be better, I think, by a new Convention . . . without distinction of color. To all the other states the general principle may be easily applied. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>
<p>On the morning after Lincoln's speech, Chase wrote again:</p>
<p>``The American of this morning contains your speech of last evening. Seeing that you say something on the subject of my letter to you yesterday---reconstruction---, &amp; refer, though without naming me, to the suggestions I made in relation to the Amnesty Proclamation, when you brought it before the Heads of Departments, I will ask your permission to add some observations to what I have already written.</p>
<p>``I recollect the suggestions you mention; my impression is that they were in writing. There was another which you do not mention and which, I think, was not in writing. It is distinct in my memory; though doubtless forgotten by you. It was an objection to the restriction of participation in reorganization to persons having the qualifications of voters under the laws of their several states just before rebellion.</p>
<p>``Ever since questions of reconstruction have been talked about, it has been my opinion that the colored loyalists ought to be allowed to participate in it and it was because of this opinion that I was anxious to have this question left open. I did not however say much about the restriction. I was the only one who expressed a wish for its omission; &amp; I did not desire to seem pertinacious.</p>
<p>``You will remember, doubtless, that the first order ever issued for enrollment with a view to reconstruction went to General Shepley &amp; directed the enrollment of all loyal citizens; and I suppose that, since the opinion of Attorney General Bates, no one, connected with your administration, has questioned the citizenship of free colored men more than that of free white men. The restriction in the amnesty proclamation operated as a revocation of the order to General Shepley:---but, as I understood you not to be wedded to any particular plan of reconstruction, I hoped &amp; believed that reflection &amp; observation would probably satisfy you that the restriction should not be adhered to.</p>
<p>``I fully sympathized with your desire for the restoration of the Union by the change of rebel slave States into Union free States; and was willing, if I could not get exactly the plan I thought best, to take the plan you thought best, &amp; to trust the future for modifications. I welcomed, therefore, with joy the prospects of good results from the cooperation of General Banks with the free state men of Louisiana. I think General Banks' error, &amp; I have said so to him, was in not acting through instead of over the Free State Committee. This Committee had already shown itself disposed to a degree of liberality towards the colored people quite remarkable at that time. They had admitted delegates from the creole colored population into their free State Convention, &amp; had evinced a readiness to admit intelligent colored citizens of that class to the rights of suffrage. I have <span class="rend-i">no</span> doubt that great &amp; satisfactory progress would have been made in the same direction had not the work been taken out of their hands. This created the impression that the advocates of general suffrage were to be treated with disfavor by the representatives of the Government. Discouragement &amp; disinterest were the natural consequences.</p>
<p>``For one I was glad of all the good that was done; and, naturally, wanted more. So when I came to Washington last winter I saw Gen Banks: and, being now more deeply than ever persuaded of the necessity of universal suffrage, I begged him to write himself &amp; to induce the Senators &amp; Representatives elect from Louisiana to write to members of the Legislature and urge them to exercise their power under the constitution by passing an act extending suffrage to colored citizens. I knew that many of our best men in and out of Congress had become thoroughly convinced of the impolicy and injustice of allowing representation in Congress to States which had been in rebellion and were not yet prepared to concede equal political rights to all loyal citizens. They felt that if such representation should be allowed &amp; such states reinstated in all their former rights as loyal members of the Union, the colored population would be practically abandoned to the disposition of the white population, with every probability against them; and this, they believed would be equally unjust &amp; dangerous.</p>
<p>``I shared their sentiment &amp; was therefore extremely desirous that General Banks should take the action I urged upon him. I thought indeed that he concurred, mainly, in my views, &amp; would to some extent at least act upon them. I must have been mistaken, for I never heard that he did anything in that direction.</p>
<p>``I know you attach much importance to the admission of Louisiana, or rather to the recognition of her right to representation in Congress as a loyal State in the Union. If I am not misinformed there is nothing in the way except the indisposition of her Legislature to give satisfactory proof of loyalty by a sufficient guaranty of safety &amp; justice to colored citizens through the extension to loyal colored men of the right of suffrage. Why not, then, as almost every loyal man concurs with you as to the desirableness of that recognition, take the shortest road to it by causing every proper representation to be made to the Louisiana Legislature of the importance of such extension.</p>
<p>``I most earnestly wish you could have read the New Orleans papers for the last few months. Your duties have not allowed it. I have read them a good deal---quite enough to be satisfied that, if you had read what I have, your feelings of humanity &amp; justice would not let you rest till <span class="rend-i">all</span> loyalists are made equal in the right of self protection by suffrage.</p>
<p>``Once I should have been, if not satisfied, reasonably contented by suffrage for the more intelligent &amp; for those who have been soldiers; now I am convinced that universal suffrage is demanded by sound policy and impartial justice alike.</p>
<p>``I have written too much already &amp; will not trouble you with my reasons for this conclusion. I shall return to Washington in a day or two &amp; perhaps it will not be disagreeable to you to have the whole subject talked over. . . .'' (DLC-RTL).</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ALS, DNA WR RG 107, Presidential Telegrams, I, 385. The time of this telegram is marked by the clerk as 9 A.M. On April 9, Charles A. Dana had telegraphed Stanton from Richmond: ``On Friday evening I asked Weitzel . . . what he was going to do about opening the churches on Sunday. He answered that all were to be allowed to be opened on condition that no disloyalty should be uttered and that the Episcopal ministers would be required to read the prayer<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;406</span></p>
<p>for the President. . . . I told him this was all right. Last evening he sent [George F.] Shepley to me to ask that this order might be relaxed, so that the clergy would only be required not to pray for Jeff. Davis. Shepley said this was what had been determined on by . . . Weitzel before I gave orders to the contrary. I answered I had given no orders at all . . . and that Weitzel must act in the matter entirely on his own judgment. It appears that Judge Campbell thought it very desirable that a loyal prayer should not be exacted, and that Weitzel had consented to it; but when I asked him the question . . . he gave me an answer opposite to the reality. I report the fact, confessing that it shakes a good deal my confidence in Weitzel. . . .'' (OR, I, XLVI, III, 677).</p>
<p>Whereupon Stanton telegraphed Weitzel: ``It has just been reported to this Department that you have, at the instance of Mr. Campbell, consented that service should be performed in the Episcopal churches of Richmond to-day without the usual prayer said in loyal churches of that denomination for the President . . . and that you have even agreed to waive that condition. If such has been your action it is strongly condemned by this Department . . . you are directed immediately to report by telegraph your action in relation to religious services in Richmond . . . and also to state what took place between you and Mr. Campbell on the subject. . . .'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>., p. 678).</p>
<p>Weitzel replied the next day: ``The orders in relation to religious services in Richmond were verbal, and were applicable alike to all religious denominations. . . . They were, in substance, that no expression would be allowed in any part of the church service . . . which in any way implied a recognition of any other authority than that of the United States. . . . No orders were given as to what would be preached or prayed for, but only as to what would not be permitted. . . . I have had personally but three interviews with Judge Campbell---two of them in the presence of, and the other by the written command of, the President. In neither of these interviews was any question discussed in relation to church or prayers. . . .'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>., pp. 696-97).</p>
<p>On April 11, James A. Hardie telegraphed Weitzel: ``The Secretary of War directs me to say that your explanation . . . is not satisfactory. . . . The Secretary also directs me to instruct you that officers commanding in Richmond are expected to require from all religious denominations in that city, in regard to their rituals and prayers, no less respect for the President . . . than they practiced toward the rebel chief . . . before he was driven from the capital.'' (<span class="rend-i">Ibid</span>., p. 711).</p>
<p>Weitzel's reply to Lincoln's telegram of April 12 was received at 3 P.M.: ``You spoke of not pressing little points. You said you would not order me, but if you were in my place you would not press them. The passports have gone out for the legislature, and it is common talk that they will come together.''

<p>I have just seen Judge Campbell's letter to you of the 7th. He assumes as appears to me that I have called the insurgent Legislature of Virginia together, as the rightful Legislature of the State, to settle all differences with the United States. I have done no such thing. I spoke of them not as a Legislature, but as ``the gentlemen who have <span class="rend-i">acted</span> as the Legislature of Virginia in support<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;407</span>
of the rebellion.'' I did this on purpose to exclude the assumption that I was recognizing them as a <span class="rend-i">rightful</span> body. I dealt with them as men having power <span class="rend-i">de facto</span> to do a specific thing, towit, ``to withdraw the Virginia troops, and other support from resistance to the General Government,'' for which in the paper handed Judge Campbell I promised a specific equivalent, to wit, a remission to the people of the State, except in certain cases, the confiscation of their property. I meant this and no more. In as much however as Judge Campbell misconstrues this, and is still pressing for an armistice, contrary to the explicit statement of the paper I gave him; and particularly as Gen. Grant has since captured the Virginia troops, so that giving a consideration for their withdrawal is no longer applicable, let my letter to you, and the paper to Judge Campbell both be withdrawn or, counter-manded, and he be notified of it. Do not now allow them to assemble; but if any have come, allow them safe-return to their homes. A. LINCOLN</p>

See Lincoln's memorandum to Campbell, April 5, and communications to Grant and to Weitzel, April 6, <span class="rend-i">supra</span>. On April 7, Judge Campbell wrote Weitzel:</p>
<p>``The events of the war have placed under the military control of the United States the natural and artificial channels of communication of the Confederate States, their emporiums of commerce and intercourse, and all the places that have any special importance in a military point of view. The armies of the Confederacy are diminished in point of numbers, and debilitated from the want of adequate equipments, transportation, and supplies. The spirit of the people is not broken and the resources of the country allow of a prolonged and embarrassing resistance. Humanity as well as patriotism requires that such a contest, which must be in the end fruitless, should be averted. To do this is the province of enlarged and [wise] statesmanship. The obstacles to an immediate accommodation arise [from the] condition of the Confederate Government and nature of the questions involved [in] the war. The Confederate Government has made no provision [for] the possibility of its failure. Its functionaries don't understand how [they] can negotiate for the subversion or overthrow of their [Government]. All the powers of negotiation are in the hands of the [President], and he is not willing to employ them for such [a] result. The affections and hopes of the people are concentrated [in] the Army, and it will be difficult to bring them [to] take action without the co-operation and counsel of their [brethren] of the army. Thus while reflecting persons are convinced that the [cause] of the Confederate States can't be achieved, and they are predisposed [to] an adjustment, there is a great difficulty in obtaining an [acknowledgment] of this conviction from a legally constituted authority. I [think] that an armistice would obviate much of this difficulty, nor [do] I believe that there would be any danger of a [delay] in securing peace by this temporary cessation of hostilities. The [disbanding] of the armies would be the probable, I may say the [certain], result of such a measure.</p>
<p>``The legislature of Virginia [will or should] be immediately convened. The legislature of South Carolina will meet according [to] adjournment in May.</p>
<p>``The President of the United States in his memorandum left with [me] states three indispensable conditions to peace, which when examined are [all] included<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;408</span>
in the single one of the restoration of the Union by [the] consent of the seceding States. If his proclamations upon the subject of slavery have the force of law I suppose that it became operative when it was issued, and that rights were vested under it. I do not presume that his revocation of that proclamation could destroy the rights thus acquired.</p>
<p>``The acceptance of the Union involves acceptance of his proclamation, if it be valid as a law. In Virginia the question of limits is one of great concern and interest, and in both States the averages of taxes, the confiscation acts, the bills of pains and penalties, the oaths of allegiance, the right to representation in Congress, and the condition of the slave population, are subjects of importance. I do not very well see how these matters can be adjusted without a very grave, important, and patient inquiry between the parties; that is, the United States and the authorities of the States. I have stated that the regular session of the legislature of South Carolina will be held in May. I would recommend that all the facilities offered in Virginia to the assembling of their legislature be extended to that State, and that it be invited to send commissioners to adjust the questions that are supposed to require adjustment.</p>
<p>``I have made a statement of the practical difficulties that exist in order to encourage you to persevere in the course of patience, moderation, forbearance, and conciliation that has marked your conduct since you entered Richmond. Many of the difficulties will be removed or lessened by such a course, and I do not know of any that will not be aggravated by the adoption of the opposite.'' (OR, I, XLVI, III, 657.

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; ES, RPB. The heading and body of this endorsement are in John Hay's handwriting. The endorsement appears on a letter from William R. Tracy of Hamilton County, Tennessee, September 17, 1863:</p>
<p>``I respectfully submit the enclosed recommendation from the principal officers in the service from East Tennessee, for the position of Paymaster in the Army. I present the paper myself, as we have at present neither Senator, or Representative in Congress, from our section of the country. I would state to you that there are <span class="rend-i">Fourteen</span> (14) Regiments now in the field, in the service of the United States, and that there is no Paymaster appointed for Tennessee, the above <span class="rend-i">14</span> Regts. being all from East Tennessee. I have served my country in the field faithfully, for nearly two years. And should your Excellency see fit to comply with the wishes of my friends, I will still do my utmost duty. I am an exile from my home in East Tennessee which I left at the commencement of the War, and I have lost all the property I left behind me.</p>
<p>``From a private soldier in the ranks, with no influence but my exertions I rose to the rank of Major in the 1st. East Tennessee Cavalry. . . .''</p>
<p>Tracy was appointed captain and commissary of subsistence of Volunteers, June 30, 1864, but no record has been found of his appointment as paymaster.</p>

On January 17, 1848, Representative Robert Smith of Illinois, introduced H.R. 87, a bill to grant to the State of Illinois a right of way through the public lands, to aid in the construction of the Northern Cross Railroad. The bill was referred to the committee on public lands, but was never reported. On February 8, 1849, S. 13, another bill to grant the State of Illinois a right of way through public lands was laid before the House and referred to the committee on public lands. Representative Jacob Collamer reported the bill and moved that it should pass. There was no second. On February 28, Representative Samuel F. Vinton moved that the bill be reconsidered. Consideration was postponed. On March 3, Representative John Wentworth moved to consider Vinton's motion of February 28, but following debate the motion was tabled and the bill died.</p>

<p>I have been at a good deal of pains to get the information you want. As I now understand it, Shandy assigned to Fogg, three notes on Constant, two of them for $150 each, one due one year after date, &amp; the other due in two years, both dated May 9th. 1839,---the other for $45---due one year after date, dated May 10th. 1839---on the last, there is a credit of $18.00, as of June 16th. 1841. Constant had a mortgage against White to secure four notes, three of them, for $250 each, and the fourth for $450---he sold three of the notes &amp; retained one of the $250 ones. The mortgaged property was sold on the 27th. day of August 1844. for $550---and it has not been redeemed. It was sold for the ratable benefit of these four notes; and consequently the ratio of the 250 note retained by Constant goes to Fogg. It's ratio, as I count it, is $114.581/3 cents, to be credited on the Shandy notes as of date 27th August 1844. The ballance of those notes remain unpaid. This</p>

<span class="rend-b">TO THE PEOPLE OF SANGAMON COUNTY</span><br>
Fellow Citizens:<br>
</div>
<p>I have this moment been shown a handbill signed ``Truth Teller,'' in which my name is done up in large capitals. No one can doubt the object of this attack at this late hour. An effort is now made to show that John T. Stuart and myself opposed the passage of the bill by which the Wiggins loan was paid. The handbill says---``The only vote taken on the bill when the yeas and nays were taken, was upon engrossing the bill for a third reading.'' That's a lie. Let the reader refer to pages, 124, 125 &amp; 126 of the Journal,<span class="ptr"><a name="8_429_2"></a>&nbsp;<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln8?id=8_429_2;note=ptr;rgn=main;view=trgt">[2]</a></span> and he will see that the yeas and nays were taken <span class="rend-i">twice</span> upon the bill <span class="rend-i">after</span> the vote referred to by this lying Truth Teller. And he will also see that my course toward the bill was anything but unfriendly. It is impossible to make a lengthy answer at this late hour. All I have to say is that the author is a <span class="rend-i">liar</span> and a <span class="rend-i">scoundrel</span>, and that if he will avow the authorship to me, I promise to give his proboscis a good wringing. A. LINCOLN.</p>

<p>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy, IHi. This copy is in the handwriting of Joseph Wallace who states in a postscript that it is a ``copy of an Election Handbill issud by Mr Lincoln . . . found among the old papers of the late Archer G. Herndon of Springfield [Illinois]. It is without date, but was probably issued on the eve of the [congressional] election in 1836.'' Another copy in Wallace's handwriting is owned by Mrs. Edna Orendorff Macpherson, Springfield, Illinois.</p>

<span class="pbtext">Page &nbsp;430</span><h2>APPENDIX II</h2>
<p>IN this index the editors have listed chronologically writings for which no text has been found, forgeries and spurious or dubious items attributed to Lincoln, certain routine communications issued on Lincoln's authority, and routine endorsements. Although the editors have tried to list all those items which in their opinion would be of service to the student, the list is necessarily selective. Except in particular cases, the following categories of documents have <span class="rend-i">not</span> been listed: nominations, land grants, discharge papers, ships' papers, routine pardon and clemency endorsements, draft orders, approvals, appointments, authorizations, and commissions.</p>
<p>Abbreviations are the same as those used throughout the <span class="rend-i">Complete Works</span> except for an additional symbol NE adopted specifically for this list. The symbol NE indicates that, in so far as the editors have been able to determine, the item is not extant.</p>

<div class="opener">Springfield,<br>
Dear Gillespie--- March 29. 1850</div>
<p>I suppose you are well acquainted at Greenville, and attend court there regularly. There are, at or near that place, two brothers, and a brother-in-law, by the names of Richard Briggs, Henry Briggs, and James Bradford. They have a niece here, a near neighbor of mine, by the name of Stout, formerly Huldah Briggs, who thinks they have wronged her in relation to the estates of her grand-father and grand-mother Briggs---and she is resolved to be righted if possible. I doubt not she confidently believes in the justice of her cause; and she has so far convinced me, that I strongly sympathise with her, and intend to not drop the case till I know more about it. She writes them, and they will not answer her---itself a suspicious circumstance. Now I desire you, as a favor to me, when next you are there, to see them, and tell them of this determination of hers, and notify them to do her justice, either by giving her, her own, or taking the small trouble of convincing her, that they have nothing of hers. Generally, find out all you can, in your own way, about the matter, and write the result to Ebenezer Stout, the lady's husband, at this place. Write <span class="rend-i">him</span>, because <span class="rend-i">I</span> shall be absent on the circuit. The grand-father died in Massachusetts; and the grand-mother in Bond county, whither it is thought she brought effects of her husband, and where she certainly drew a large pension for several years. Whether there was any administration in Bond, of the effects of either, you can readily see.</p>
<p>Please attend to this without failure; and I will do as much, with interest, for you, on demand. Yours as ever A. LINCOLN---</p>

Casey replied: ``I have Recd your letter of this date and and (<span class="rend-i">sic</span>) will do as you direct.'' (DLC-RTL). With Lincoln's letter is an account by Casey's son, George F. Casey of Greenville, Illinois, May 18, 1928, contending it was Lincoln's plan to send his father to General E. Kirby Smith, CSA, at Shreveport on the Red River ``to negotiate for the disbanding of his troops, thus releasing . . . forces under Banks from guard duty'' and to purchase ``three years' crops of cotton.'' Successful in his mission, Casey left for Washington, but at Vicksburg learned of Banks' expedition up the Red River, and the ultimate destruction of the cotton by the Confederates. See Fred H. Harrington, <span class="rend-i">Fighting Politician Major General N. P.
